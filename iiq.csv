Whether you're new to influencer marketing or seeking to optimize your existing strategies, this comprehensive guide will equip you with the knowledge and insights to navigate the world of influencers effectively.

What is Influencer Marketing? How Does it Work?

Influencer marketing is a form of marketing that utilizes endorsements and product mentions from individuals (influencers) who have a large following on social media platforms. It revolves around utilizing the reach and authority of these online personalities to promote products or services to their followers.

The rise of social media in recent years has led to a surge in the popularity of influencer marketing as it allows brands to target their audience with greater precision and authenticity. Through influencer marketing, brands can reach customers organically and engagingly, leveraging the trust and credibility of the influencer to promote their products.

Influencer marketing can work alongside other marketing channels, such as social media, content, and digital advertising, to amplify brand reach and drive sales. With the help of influencers, brands can build lasting relationships with their audience and position themselves as trusted and relatable figures in their respective industries.

What are the Types of Influencers & Top Channels

Influencer marketing has revolutionized the way brands connect with their target audience. Influencers, with their ability to engage and sway consumer behavior, have become powerful brand advocates. However, influencers come in various forms, each with its own unique characteristics and reach.

Top Influencer Marketing Channels

Instagram: Instagram is one of the leading platforms for influencer marketing, with over 1 billion monthly active users. Its visual nature and features like Stories, IGTV, and Reels make it ideal for showcasing products and creating engaging content. In a survey, 89% of marketers stated that Instagram was the most important platform for influencer marketing.

YouTube: YouTube is a dominant video-sharing platform, with over 2 billion monthly active users. It offers various content types, making it suitable for various industries. YouTube influencers have the advantage of creating long-form, informative, and entertaining content. According to a survey, 70% of teenagers on YouTube trust influencer opinions over traditional celebrities.

TikTok: TikTok has skyrocketed in popularity, especially among younger demographics, with over 1 billion monthly active users. Its short-form video format and viral content trends have created a unique space for influencer marketing. Brands leverage TikTok influencers to reach a global audience and capitalize on its engaging and highly shareable content.

Facebook: As one of the largest social media platforms, Facebook remains relevant for influencer marketing, with over 2.8 billion monthly active users. Facebook influencers can use written posts, images, videos, and live streaming to engage with their audience. Facebook also offers ad targeting capabilities to amplify influencer content.

Twitter: Twitter's real-time nature and conversational style make it suitable for influencer marketing. Influencers often leverage Twitter to share their thoughts and opinions and engage in discussions with their audience. Brands can collaborate with influencers to tap into trending topics and join relevant conversations.

Why Do Brands Choose Influencer Marketing? Importance & Benefits

Traditional advertising methods are gradually losing their impact in today's fast-paced digital landscape. As consumers increasingly filter out promotional messages, brands use new strategies to reach their target audiences effectively.

By leveraging the power of influential individuals on social media platforms, brands can connect with their customers more authentically and relatable. Let's look at some of the benefits of influencer marketing for brands -

1. Increased Brand Awareness

Influencer marketing allows brands to amplify their reach and increase brand awareness. By partnering with influencers with a significant following and an engaged audience, brands can expose their products or services to a broader and more relevant demographic. Influencers act as brand advocates, sharing their experiences and opinions and creating a buzz around the brand, helping expand its reach and visibility.

Most Gen Z and Millennials, specifically 72%, tend to follow influencers today. 50% of people say social media is where they most often learn about new products to buy.

2. Enhanced Credibility and Trust

One of the most significant advantages of influencer marketing is building trust and credibility. Influencers are seen as experts or thought leaders in their respective niches, and their recommendations hold sway over their followers. When an influencer endorses a brand or product, it resonates with their audience and instills confidence in their purchasing decisions. By leveraging the credibility of influencers, brands can tap into the trust they have built and establish themselves as trustworthy and reliable in the eyes of consumers.

3. Targeted Audience Engagement

Influencers deeply understand their audience's preferences, interests, and demographics. This knowledge enables them to create tailored content that resonates with their followers. When brands collaborate with influencers whose audience aligns with their target market, they can precisely target and engage potential customers. By crafting relevant and compelling content in collaboration with influencers, brands can generate higher levels of engagement, resulting in increased brand loyalty and conversions.

4. Cost-Effective Marketing Strategy

Influencer marketing often offers a more cost-effective approach than traditional advertising channels. And it delivers! Today, 1 in 4 Gen Z prefers to find out about products from influencers! Furthermore, on average, influencer marketing generates $6.50 in revenue for each $1 invested.

Brands can choose to work with micro-influencers with a smaller but highly engaged audience and negotiate collaborations at a lower cost. Additionally, influencer marketing allows brands to reach their target audience directly without intermediaries, reducing costs associated with distribution and middlemen.

5. Authentic Content Creation

Authenticity is a vital element in today's marketing landscape. Influencers are known for their ability to create genuine and relatable content that resonates with their followers. When brands collaborate with influencers, they gain access to this authentic content creation expertise. Influencers integrate the brand seamlessly into their content, ensuring that it aligns with their style and the preferences of their audience. As a result, the brand's message feels more organic, which can lead to higher engagement and acceptance among consumers.

6. Improved SEO and Online Presence

Influencer collaborations can significantly impact a brand's online presence and search engine optimization (SEO) efforts. When influencers mention or promote a brand, it generates valuable backlinks and increases its visibility on search engines. This can positively influence the brand's search engine rankings and organic traffic. Moreover, influencer-created content often generates social media buzz, increasing brand mentions and social signals, further boosting the brand's online presence.

Best Practices to Follow in Your Influencer Marketing Campaigns

Launching a successful influencer marketing campaign requires careful planning, strategic execution, and adherence to best practices. By following these guidelines, brands can maximize the effectiveness of their influencer collaborations and achieve their campaign goals -

Identify the Right Influencers

Find influencers aligning with your brand values, target audience, and campaign objectives. Take the time to research and identify influencers who have an engaged following in your niche. Analyze their content, engagement rates, audience demographics, and authenticity. insightIQ can assist in this process by providing comprehensive influencer insights, including audience demographics, engagement metrics, and previous brand collaborations, helping you make informed decisions in influencer selection.

Develop a Creative Brief

Once you've chosen the influencers for your campaign, provide them with a detailed creative brief. Clearly outline your expectations, campaign guidelines, key messaging, and any specific deliverables you require. Encourage influencers to infuse their creativity while ensuring that the content aligns with your brand's tone and values. insightIQ simplifies the briefing process by providing a collaborative platform to share campaign details, guidelines, and assets with influencers, fostering effective communication and content alignment.

Ensure Disclosure and Transparency

Transparency is vital in influencer marketing to maintain trust and comply with advertising regulations. Ensure that influencers clearly disclose their partnership with your brand in their content, adhering to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines or relevant regulatory bodies. insightIQ can help you track and manage influencer disclosures, ensuring that your campaigns are compliant and transparent.

Building successful influencer marketing campaigns comes with its fair share of challenges and potential pitfalls. In this section, we will explore the common pain points in influencer marketing and provide insights on how to overcome them. We will also discuss how influencer marketing platforms like insightIQ can help mitigate these challenges and maximize campaign success.

1. Identifying the Right Influencers

One of the major challenges in influencer marketing is finding influencers who align with your brand values and have an engaged and relevant audience. Conducting extensive research and manually identifying suitable influencers can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This is where influencer marketing platforms like insightIQ come in handy. insightIQ offers its Identity API that lets you easily verify creator identity and profile data to get deep insights into their fan following and reputation.

2. Managing Influencer Relationships and Campaigns

Managing multiple influencer collaborations and coordinating communication can become overwhelming, especially when working with influencers across different platforms. Influencer marketing platforms like insightIQ streamline the campaign management process. We provide centralized solutions that one can leverage to track influencer relationships, share creative briefs, review content, and collaborate with influencers seamlessly.

3. Ensuring Authenticity and Transparency

Maintaining authenticity and transparency in influencer marketing is crucial to building trust with your audience. However, ensuring influencers comply with disclosure guidelines and creating genuine, relatable content can be a challenge.

4. Measuring Campaign Performance and ROI

Measuring the effectiveness and ROI of influencer marketing campaigns can be complex without proper tracking and analytics. Determining which influencers are driving the most engagement, conversions, and overall campaign success requires robust measurement tools.

Inadequate Research: Rushing the influencer selection process without thorough research can result in misaligned partnerships. Take the time to evaluate influencers' content, engagement, and audience demographics to ensure relevance and authenticity.

Lack of Authenticity: Pushing influencers to create content that doesn't align with their style or feels forced can harm your campaign's authenticity and credibility. Allow influencers creative freedom to maintain authenticity and resonate with their audience.

Tips to Build Relationships with Influencers

Building strong relationships with influencers is a crucial aspect of influencer marketing success. Nurturing these relationships allows brands to tap into the authenticity and influence of influencers, resulting in more impactful campaigns and long-term partnerships. Here are a few tips to achieve this -

1. Research and Choose the Right Influencers

Start by conducting thorough research to identify influencers who align with your brand values, target audience, and campaign goals. Look for influencers whose content resonates with your brand and who have an engaged and relevant following. Building a relationship with the right influencers lays a strong foundation for successful collaborations.

2. Engage and Interact with Influencers

Engagement is key to building relationships with influencers. Take the time to genuinely interact with their content by liking, commenting, and sharing their posts. Show genuine interest in their work and engage in meaningful conversations. This demonstrates your appreciation for their content and establishes a connection.

3. Personalize Your Outreach

When reaching out to influencers for collaborations, personalize your communication. Avoid generic messages and demonstrate that you have done your research by referencing specific content or campaigns they have worked on. Tailor your outreach to highlight how their expertise and style align with your brand, making them feel valued and respected.

4. Offer Value and Benefits

Influencers are more likely to engage with brands that provide value and benefits beyond monetary compensation. Offer influencers unique experiences, exclusive access to products or events, or co-creation opportunities that resonate with their interests. By offering something meaningful, you can build a mutually beneficial relationship that goes beyond a simple transaction.

5. Provide Clear and Detailed Briefs

When working with influencers, provide them with clear and detailed briefs for your campaigns. Clearly outline your expectations, key messages, deliverables, and any guidelines or creative preferences. This ensures that the influencer understands your brand's vision and helps create content that aligns with your objectives.

6. Respect Influencers' Creative Freedom

While it's important to provide guidelines, it is equally crucial to respect influencers' creative freedom. Allow them to bring their unique voice and creativity to the collaboration. Influencers have a deep understanding of their audience and know what resonates with them. Trust their expertise and give them the freedom to create content that is authentic and genuine.

7. Show Appreciation and Recognition

Acknowledging and appreciating influencers' efforts is essential for building strong relationships. When influencers create content for your brand, show gratitude by publicly thanking them, sharing their content across your social media channels, and tagging them. This recognition helps strengthen the relationship and encourages them to continue supporting your brand.

8. Maintain Ongoing Communication

Building relationships with influencers is an ongoing process. Maintain regular communication even when you're not currently collaborating on a campaign. Stay updated on their work, engage with their content, and continue building rapport. This paves the way for future collaborations and establishes a genuine connection that goes beyond business transactions.

Distribution: In the past, building for this economy primarily involved integrating with platforms like Instagram or YouTube. However, the landscape has shifted, and now there are many more equally important platforms to consider. This expansion necessitates the need for numerous custom integrations. At insightIQ, we offer comprehensive coverage for platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Twitch, Twitter, Pinterest, Discord, Substack, Shopify, Patreon, and more. Explore the platforms supported by insightIQ by referring to the list here.

Time to go live: Developing custom integrations of this nature involves several sequential steps, which include defining use cases, researching platforms and documentation, data normalization, application engineering, source platform approval. Depending on the organization's size and use cases, this process can take months, if not quarters. Furthermore, this process needs to be repeated for each new platform integration. With insightIQ, it's just one unified solution for all platforms.

Cost of ongoing maintenance: Integrating with social/creator platforms requires continuous maintenance. This includes keeping up with changes in the platform's API, resolving ongoing integration issues, debugging errors, and providing support.

How do we calculate the engagement rate?

Engagement on Instagram encompasses every interaction from your audience--likes, comments, and even shares. The formula to calculate engagement rate is straightforward: Add up all the engagements (likes, comments, etc.) across their posts, divide by their followers, and multiply by 100.

It reveals the median engagement rate for posts, so we tend to exclude statistical outliers for a fair assessment. We base our calculations on the most recent 30 influencer posts, ensuring you have the latest and most accurate engagement data.

Which type of posts bring in the best engagement?

Delving into Instagram engagement, carousel posts lead with an impressive 0.77% user engagement due to their interactive, swipeable format. While full 10-slide carousels excel, those with around four slides lag. Mixing videos and photos boosts engagement. Videos achieve 0.68% engagement, while standalone photos rate at 0.58%, the lowest among Instagram post types.

Let's get things cleared up

What is Instagram engagement?

Instagram engagement refers to users' interaction and connection with content on the platform. It encompasses likes, comments, shares, saves, Story views, and direct messages (DMs), among other forms of interaction with a given Instagram profile.

Why should I Calculate an Influencer's Engagement Rate?

Low engagement suggests that the audience is not receptive to the content. It may also signal a significant presence of inactive accounts or automated bots among the creator's followers. For a precise evaluation of individual Instagram profiles, you can use our Instagram Engagement Calculator.

How to calculate the engagement rate on Instagram?

Instagram Engagement includes any action taken by a user on a post. This includes things like likes, comments, and Stories views. The insightIQ free Instagram engagement calculator uses this simple formula to calculate Instagram engagement rate:

We base this calculation on the 30 most recent posts to give you the average engagement rate. However, we exclude posts with extremely high or low engagement rates as they can skew the results. This way, we provide a fair evaluation.

With the insightIQ Instagram Engagement Rate Calculator, you can quickly check how well an Instagram account is performing. Our calculation is precise and free to use on the official insightIQ website.

How to calculate the engagement rate per post on Instagram?

To calculate the engagement rate per post on Instagram, use this formula:

This measures the engagement of a specific post relative to your total followers.

How to use the insightIQ Engagement Rate Calculator to find influencers for your brand?

In influencer marketing, high audience engagement means the audience is eager to interact with the influencer's posts. This is crucial for identifying an active and responsive audience for your campaign. For Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) brands, the engagement rate is a key factor in predicting the success of influencer marketing and calculating ROI.

What is a good engagement rate on Instagram in 2024?

Given that the average Instagram Engagement Rate is 2.2%, any value higher than this number is considered good. Note that when using an Instagram Engagement Rate Calculator to assess a profile, you should compare accounts with a similar number of followers for a fair evaluation.

What is the highest engagement on Instagram?

The highest engagement rate on Instagram is usually between 30-40%. However, such a high engagement rate often means the likes and comments were artificially boosted. The insightIQ Instagram engagement calculator is designed to spot this kind of activity.

Why is my IG engagement so low?

A low engagement rate suggests poor content and audience quality/resonance. It's important to check if your followers are real and authentic. If you have many fake or suspicious accounts following you, your engagement rate will go down. These are what we call low-quality followers.

But it's not just about the followers; the content you post matters too. If you don't post often and your content isn't interesting or exciting, your followers might stop liking and commenting on your posts. So, keep your content fresh, engaging, and relevant to your audience!

The Ultimate B2B Influencer Marketing Strategy: How to Succeed

In B2B marketing, traditional marketing tactics like cold calling and emails aren't as effective anymore - only 1% of cold calls ultimately lead to appointments. Decision-makers are overwhelmed with information, and it's hard for brands to stand out. That's where the best influencer marketing platform comes in!

Business

August 1, 2023

You've probably seen influencers promoting products on social media, right? Well, the same concept applies to B2B. Partnering with industry experts and professionals can work wonders for your brand.

What is B2B influencer marketing?

By partnering with influencers who align with your brand values, you can tap into their expertise and network to amplify your message and drive business growth.

Future Trends in B2B Influencer Marketing



As we look ahead to the future of B2B influencer marketing, several key trends are shaping the landscape and presenting exciting opportunities for businesses. Let's explore some of these future trends:

Micro and Nano-influencers

Say goodbye to the era of mega influencers! Now, it's all about micro-influencers and nano-influencers. These guys may have smaller followings, but they make up for it with highly engaged and niche-specific audiences. In fact, almost half (47.3%) of influencers are micro-influencers with 5,000 to 20,000 followers.

Employee Advocacy

Did you know your employees can be influencers too? That's right! Employee advocacy is on the rise in B2B influencer marketing. Imagine empowering and encouraging your team members to become brand advocates. By leveraging their expertise and networks, they can amplify your digital marketing and efforts.

Video and Live Streaming

Lights, camera, action! Video, content marketing and live streaming are taking the B2B influencer marketing world by storm. Influencers are not just content creators but on-screen stars! They can showcase their expertise, engage with their audience, and provide valuable insights through captivating videos.

Long-Term Partnerships

Forget about short flings; long-term partnerships are the new cool. Brands and influencers are swiping right for lasting collaborations. You can build trust, consistency, and a deeper connection with your audience by nurturing long-term relationships.

AI-Driven Influencer Selection

Let's give a round of applause to artificial intelligence! AI is revolutionizing influencer marketing by making the selection process smarter and faster. 37.4% of respondents reported that the application of AI technologies has significantly improved their influencer marketing outcomes.

Authenticity and Transparency

In a world where authenticity rules, B2B influencer marketing is no exception. Audiences crave genuine connections and honest recommendations from influencers. Being transparent about partnerships and building authentic relationships with influencers are key to maintaining credibility and trust.

Virtual Influencers and AI-Personalities

These computer-generated characters and AI-driven personas are making waves in B2B influencer marketing. They offer precise targeting, consistent messaging, and complete creative control. Just imagine the possibilities of collaborating with real users and these virtual influencers!

Benefits of leveraging influencers in B2B marketing strategies



Leveraging influencers in B2B marketing strategies can offer several significant benefits. Let's take a closer look at some of the key advantages:

Boost Brand Awareness

Influencers have a strong following, so teaming up with them expands your brand's reach. It creates buzz, increases visibility, and gets your name out there.

Build Credibility and Trust

Influencers are trusted authorities in their niche. When they endorse your brand, their credibility rubs off on you, building trust with your audience and helping them make decisions faster.

Reach Targeted Audiences

Influencers have cultivated communities that align with specific niches. Partnering with them puts you in front of the right people genuinely interested in your offer.

Amplify Content

Influencers help spread your content far and wide. By featuring your content on their platforms or creating content together, you tap into their engaged audience, driving more traffic to your website and generating leads.

Establish Thought Leadership

Associating with influencers positions your brand as a thought leader. Their expertise and authority make you appear knowledgeable, credible, and a go-to resource in your industry.

Generate Leads and Conversions

Influencers can significantly impact lead generation and conversions. Their endorsement grabs attention from both potential customers and existing customers and influences decisions. You attract high-quality leads genuinely interested in your offerings, increasing your chances of turning them into customers.

Authenticity and Engagement

Influencer marketing brings authenticity to your campaigns. When influencers promote your brand, it feels like a genuine recommendation, not just an ad. This authenticity resonates with your audience, driving engagement and building long-term relationships.

Challenges and Opportunities of influencer marketing in B2B Compared to B2C



Limited Pool of Relevant Influencers

Finding influencers who are both knowledgeable in your industry and have a significant following can be tough in B2B. Unlike B2C, where influencers abound across various niches, B2B influencers are more specialized, making it challenging to find the right fit for your brand.

Tip: Invest time in research and networking

Research is key! Spend time delving into your industry to identify B2B influencers. Look for experts, thought leaders, industry analysts, and executives who align with your brand values. Engage with them on their social media platforms, attend industry events, and build relationships.

Longer Sales Cycles and Complex Decision-Making

B2B sales involve complex decision-making processes and longer sales cycles. Influencer marketing may not yield immediate results, as it primarily focuses on building awareness and trust with target audiences. Convincing stakeholders of the value of influencer marketing for long-term business goals can be a challenge.

Tip: Align influencer marketing with broader objectives

To overcome this challenge, align your influencer marketing strategy with your broader marketing and sales objectives. Highlight the role of influencers in building brand reputation and credibility, educating prospects, and nurturing leads throughout the buyer's journey. Provide data and case studies showcasing the effectiveness of your influencer marketing campaign. Involve decision-makers in planning and measurement to gain their support.

Complex Measurement and ROI

Measuring the impact and ROI of influencer marketing for B2B influencer marketing can be a tricky task. B2B sales involve multiple touchpoints, making it difficult to attribute conversions solely to influencer marketing campaigns alone. Moreover, influencer marketing for B2B goals often focuses on lead generation, relationship building, and thought leadership rather than immediate sales.

Tip: Set clear goals and leverage tracking tools

To tackle this challenge, set clear goals for your influencer campaigns, such as lead generation or boosting brand awareness. Leverage tracking tools to measure influencers' impact at different stages of the buyer's journey. Establish unique tracking links, use UTM parameters, and implement dedicated landing pages for accurate conversion attribution. Consider qualitative measures, like brand sentiment and engagement metrics, to get a holistic view of your influencer campaign's success.

Maintaining Authenticity and Relevance

Authenticity and relevance are crucial factors in B2B influencer marketing. Influencers must remain true to their expertise and avoid promoting too many brands or straying from their niche. B2B content can be technical, requiring influencers to balance educational and informative content creation and promotional messaging.

Tip: Seek authentic and aligned influencers

To address this challenge, look for influencers who align with your brand's values, vision, and target audience. Find those who genuinely believe in your products or services. Provide clear brand guidelines and messaging frameworks while giving influencers creative freedom. Co-create content to ensure it aligns with their expertise and meets your marketing goals.

How to Identify the Right Influencers for B2B Campaigns

Identifying the right influencers for your B2B campaigns is crucial for the success of your influencer marketing efforts. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to find and work with influencers effectively:

Define Your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

You need to start by setting your goals! What do you want to achieve with your influencer marketing campaign? Is it increased brand awareness, lead generation, conversions, or something else? Define those KPIs so you can track your success effectively.

Implement Tracking Mechanisms

It's time to get a little technical. You need to set up some tracking tools to measure the impact of your influencer campaigns. Have you heard of tracking links, UTM parameters, and dedicated landing pages? These tools will help you monitor website traffic, engagement, and conversions accurately.

Track Your Influencers' Performance

Keep a close eye on how your influencers are performing. Monitor their engagement metrics, follower growth, and the impact they have on your target audience. You want to know which influencers are making the biggest impact and resonating with your audience.

Analyze Engagement and Reach

Dive deeper into the numbers! Analyze the engagement levels and reach of the content generated by your influencers. Look at metrics like likes, comments, shares, and impressions to understand how well the influencer content resonates with your audience.

Attribute Conversions

Get ready for the exciting part! Connect the dots between your influencer campaigns and conversions. Did your influencers drive lead generation and sales? Use the tracking mechanisms to accurately measure the impact of influencers on your bottom line.

Compare Your Performance to Benchmarks

It's time to see how you stack up against the competition or your own historical data. Are you hitting the mark? Are there areas for improvement? Analyze the results and make data-driven decisions for future campaigns.

Collect Feedback from Your Influencers

Your influencers' insights and experiences are valuable. Gather their feedback on the campaign's top client success stories, challenges faced, and potential areas for improvement. Their input will help you optimize your strategies and foster stronger collaborations with other businesses.

Iterate and Optimize

Based on the insights gathered, it's time to fine-tune your influencer marketing strategies. Incorporate successful tactics, experiment with new approaches, and continuously optimize your campaigns.

Measuring and Analyzing B2B Influencer Marketing Performance

Without measuring and analyzing B2B influencer marketing performance, how will you know what's working for you and what's not?

Set goals

What do you want to achieve with your influencer marketing campaign? Is it to increase brand awareness, generate more leads, or boost sales? Think about your specific goals and how they align with your overall marketing objectives.

Use tracking

How can you track the performance of your campaign? Consider using tracking links, unique landing pages, or tools like Google Analytics to monitor website traffic, engagement, and conversions from influencer campaigns.

Keep an eye on influencers

Who are the influencers you're collaborating with? Monitor their performance closely. Look at their content engagement metrics, follower growth, and how their audience responds to their content.

Check engagement and reach

How are people engaging with the influencer-generated branded content here? Look at the number of likes, comments, shares, and impressions to gauge how well the content resonates with your target audience.

Attribute conversions

Can you attribute conversions, such as lead generation or sales, to your influencer marketing campaigns? Use the tracking methods we discussed earlier to connect the dots. This way, you can measure the direct impact of integrating influencer marketing collaborations on your bottom line.

Compare to benchmarks

How does your campaign perform compared to industry benchmarks or your past data? Analyze the metrics and see if you're meeting your targets. Identify areas where you're excelling and others that need improvement, so you can make informed decisions for future campaigns.

Get feedback from influencers

Engage with your influencers and ask for their feedback. What do they think worked well? Were there any challenges they faced? Their input is valuable and can provide insights for refining your influencer marketing strategies.

Conclusion

Leveraging influencer marketing in B2B campaigns holds immense potential for driving brand awareness, expanding reach, and generating conversions. However, finding the right influencers can be a challenging task. That's where the power of influencer marketing databases comes into play.

With the help of comprehensive influencer marketing databases, businesses gain access to a wealth of information and resources that facilitate the identification and collaboration with key influencers, who align with their industry and target specific audience here.

How to Create a Custom Instagram Dashboard for Instagram App

Instagram has come a long way since its inception. Today, it ranks among the top five social networks globally, with a massive 2 billion Instagram users browsing the app daily. Statista mentions that almost 80% of marketers use Instagram in their social media marketing.

To encourage more marketers to use Instagram, the platform has introduced a Professional Dashboard for tracking marketing campaigns. This Dashboard lets you look at campaign engagement, follower demographics, the amount of engaging content you have shared, and more.

Some demographic insights are unavailable if you have a follower count of less than 100.

You're unable to track the user sentiments.

The analytics insight of the Professional Dashboard is accessible only from mobile apps.

Finally, the Professional Dashboard is not customizable, which means you have to function with your limited information.

That's where custom Instagram dashboards come in.

In this article, we'll explore the concept of a custom Instagram dashboard and how to create one for your marketing campaigns.

But before that, let's quickly understand a custom Instagram dashboard.

Introduction to Custom Instagram Posts Dashboards

As the name suggests, custom Instagram dashboards let you customize your dashboard to the specific needs of your campaign. It helps marketers better track their campaigns and measure, monitor, and analyze various parameters to boost their social media marketing campaigns.

The Importance of Tailored Analytics for Instagram Posts

You can do a lot more with tailored analytics. For example:

Identify purchase intent: With tailored analytics, you can identify your audience's purchase intent in real-time. This can help you improve your ROI if you're running influencer marketing campaigns.

Analyse audience sentiments: With a tailored dashboard, you can grasp the tone of discussions in the comments under a sponsored Instagram post and understand the pulse of the audience beyond good or bad.

Dig deeper into Instagram stories: Connect to influencers' profiles to track their Instagram story views, link clicks, likes, and conversions.

Improve strategy with transparency: Look into previously unknown metrics from Influencer profiles, such as post impressions, cost per engagement, and total engagement on posts, to improve your strategy with data-backed evidence.

Essential Components of a Custom Instagram Dashboard

Identify all the essential metrics that you want to track and measure. Once you identify them, feed them into your dashboard.

It also has to be easy to read and navigate, or else you'll get lost in the vast pool of data.

Here are some essential components of a custom Instagram Dashboard to consider.

Profile Comparisons

Do you need to manage different profiles for different clients? Or different profiles for different segments of a business? Whatever the case, the custom dashboard should be able to break up the profiles and go deep in comparing them. When you get to compare all the profiles together, you get a better view of the trends, what's working, and what's not.

Audience Insights on Instagram Feed

While the Instagram Professional Dashboard provides some basic insight, a custom dashboard provides a deeper view of the audience's insights. Once you better understand your audience, you can retweak your campaign strategy to reach the ideal customer profile.

Highlighting Key Influencers

There's a reason why every marketer now talks about Influencer marketing. The global influencer marketing market size has tripled since 2019. In 2024, the market is estimated to reach a record of 24 billion USD. Influencers have produced some great results for brands over time.

For example, the collab post featuring bodybuilder and Gymshark athlete David Laid. The fashion-forward photos with a simple caption announcing the collection's release date and time have gotten over 324,402k likes since December 2022 and counting.

The main channel of marketing that brands look for when considering influencer marketing is Instagram.

A customized Instagram dashboard helps you identify which influencers engage with your brand and have a similar audience base. So, if you need to find new influencers for your brand, these people are the best options because they're already engaging with your brand and familiar with your product. This means that you have a better chance to collaborate with the influencer. Also, if you're already working with influencers, you can easily track who is the most active and engaging with your brand. This will help you understand which influencer brings the most value for you.

Identifying Top Posts

A custom Instagram dashboard helps you to identify your top-performing posts and videos. Once you know your top-performing posts, you can analyze the findings to create similar posts in the future. For example, you can identify the post format, how you're writing the captions, or certain filters that grab more eyeballs.

Hashtag Performance

Hashtags are an important feature on Instagram that lets the audience find your content easily. You may use a couple of hashtags in your post. Therefore, it's important to understand the top-performing hashtags that bring you the maximum traffic through your dashboard.

Engagement Metrics

Engagement indicates that your Instagram followers like your content and gives cue to the algorithm that your followers want to see more of your content. As you gain more engagement, your content will appear in your followers' Instagram feed. So tracking engagement is crucial to understand whether your posts are read and liked by the followers. For example, if you see a sudden dip in your engagement, you need to investigate if something might have gone wrong.

Competitor Analysis

While it's important to set your own campaign strategy and stick to your metrics, it's equally important to know your competitors and how their posts are performing. Use your dashboard to keep tabs on how other brands in your industry are performing, what's working for them, how their followers are growing, their campaign engagement, and so on.

Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Custom Dashboard

Now that you're ready to build your custom Instagram dashboard let's get you started.

Choosing the Right Tools and Platforms

Begin by choosing the right tool and platform to customize and integrate with the Instagram app. Investing in a tool is a big decision that involves cost. Do thorough research to understand which tool fits your budget, is easy to use, and solves all your needs.

For example, InsightsIQ gives you detailed insights on any social media post. It's simple to use, and you can get up and running from day one. The tool also lets you search for creator accounts that perfectly align with your brand offerings so that you don't need to scout through numerous profiles.

Once you select a creator for your influencer marketing, you can onboard the creator from the dashboard. No need to maintain a separate CRM for your creators.

Setting Up and Customizing Widgets

Once you have short-listed the tool, it's time to connect your Instagram account to it. Next, set up and customize the widgets to represent the specific data metrics you want to track visually.

Common widget types for Instagram may include Follower Growth, Engagement Rate, Hashtag Performance, Top Posts, Audience Demographics, and others.

Once you have selected the widgets, customize them according to your requirements.

You can add specific filters to the visual appearance by assigning different fonts, colors, and layouts, selecting a date range for the data, and so on.

Finally, arrange the widgets to give you a quick view of all the essential elements at a glance. It is usually easy to drag and drop the widgets, so arrange them according to your preference.

Finally, save your dashboard and grant access to the required team members.

Review your dashboard

Make it a habit to review your dashboard regularly and tweak and adjust your social media strategy based on your dashboard findings.

Influencer Marketing 101: Do's and Don'ts for Maximum ROI

Influencer marketing can lead to higher engagement, brand awareness, and sales when done right. However, not all influencer marketing campaigns are created equal. Many businesses find themselves scratching their heads after a failed campaign, wondering what went wrong. Without proper measurement and analysis, it's easy to overspend on an ineffective campaign that fails to resonate with your audience.

Business

August 1, 2023

In today's digital landscape, it's more challenging than ever for businesses to capture the attention of their audience. Traditional marketing methods are often perceived as inauthentic or intrusive, making it difficult for brands to build genuine connections with their customers.

However, by partnering with influential figures and social media stars, businesses can leverage the power of their reach and credibility to create authentic and engaging content that resonates with their audience. With the influencer marketing industry projected to grow to a staggering $21.1 billion by 2023, it's clear that this strategy is more than just a passing fad - it's a crucial part of any successful modern marketing strategy.

So, how do you know if your campaign was worth it? That's where influencer marketing ROI comes in.

Influencer Marketing ROI Explained

ROI, or return on investment, is a crucial metric in influencer marketing. It refers to the amount of money you make from your investment in an influencer marketing campaign. In essence, it's a way to measure the success of your campaign and determine whether it's worth the investment.

On average, businesses earn $5.20 for every dollar spent on influencer marketing campaigns, making it a lucrative strategy for many companies. So, measuring ROI is essential to determine the effectiveness of your influencer marketing campaign and ensure that you get the most out of your investment.

Imagine you're a marketer for a trendy athleisure brand, and you've just launched a new line of sustainable workout gear. You know that your audience is active, health-conscious millennials who care about the environment. So, you decide to partner with a famous fitness influencer who shares those same values and has a large following among your audience.

Together, you create a series of sponsored posts and stories on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Twitter featuring the influencer wearing your brand's new sustainable line during workouts and promoting the benefits of eco-friendly fashion. The campaign is a hit, with high engagement rates, increased brand awareness, and a significant boost in sales.

By analyzing metrics such as website traffic, conversion rates, and social media engagement, you can calculate influencer marketing ROI and adjust your strategy accordingly for future influencer partnerships.

From Likes to Profit: Importance of Influencer Marketing ROI

Measuring the ROI of your influencer marketing program is crucial, regardless of whether you're working with mega influencers, micro influencers, or nano influencers.

Why, you may ask? Well, tracking the success of your influencer marketing campaign enables you to make informed decisions about how to allocate your marketing budget. Without a solid grasp of your ROI, you risk wasting valuable resources on campaigns that do not yield the desired outcomes.

Research reveals that an overwhelming 71% of brands are actively measuring the ROI of influencer marketing in 2023. This is a clear indication that businesses are starting to take influencer marketing seriously and are determined to understand the value it brings to the table.

Now, here's the good news. When you do measure the ROI of influencer marketing, you can use that information to optimize your future campaigns and improve your overall marketing strategy. By analyzing the data, you can identify the influencers driving the most significant impact and focus your efforts on working with them. This way, you can create more targeted and effective campaigns that generate real results for your business.

Return on Ignorance: Why You Can't Afford to Ignore ROI

Let's look at a couple of examples to drive home the importance of measuring influencer marketing ROI.

Example 1: Measuring ROI

Let's say you run an online store that sells beauty products. You decide to partner with an influencer with a large following in the beauty community to promote one of your new products on YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok. You invest $5,000 in the campaign and track the results.

After the campaign, you find that you've made $10,000 in sales as a direct result of the marketing campaign. This means that you have a positive ROI of 100%, or in other words, you've made back your initial investment and then some.

Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about future influencer campaigns. You might decide to work with this influencer again or look for other influencers with similar audiences to partner with. Either way, you know that influencer marketing ROI can be a valuable tool for your business.

Example 2: Not Measuring ROI

Now, let's say you run the same beauty products store and partner with the same influencer for promoting your products on social media channels, but this time you don't track the campaign results. Instead, you invest the same $5,000 and assume that the campaign is a success because the influencer's posts get a lot of likes and comments.

However, after the campaign is over, you find that your sales haven't increased at all. Without measuring ROI, you cannot know whether or not the campaign was a success. You might assume that influencer marketing doesn't work for your business when in reality, you didn't execute the campaign correctly.

From Data to Dollars: What Metrics Can You Track?

Now that we've established why it is important to measure influencer marketing ROI, let's discuss what metrics you can track to determine your ROI.

Earned Media Value: EMV is a way to estimate the returns on an influencer's past posts for the brands they've worked with. It's a proxy for the cost of an equivalent advertising campaign that would generate the same impact. Essentially, EMV measures the value a brand receives from content an influencer shares.

Sales Revenue: This is the most obvious metric to track. If you're running a campaign to increase sales, you need to track your sales revenue to determine whether or not the campaign is working.

Website Traffic: Tracking web traffic is another critical metric for measuring the success of your campaign. By using tracking links or UTM parameters, you can determine how much traffic your social media influencers drive to your website. This is especially useful if your campaign is focused on driving website conversions or increasing overall website traffic.

Engagement Metrics: Engagement metrics are a great way to determine whether or not your campaign is resonating with your target audience. You can track metrics such as likes, comments, shares, and overall engagement rate to see how your audience interacts with your content. Using an influencer marketing platform and google analytics can provide valuable metrics and analytics. Some popular influencer marketing platforms include AspireIQ, CreatorIQ, and Upfluence.

Brand Mentions: Another way to track the success of your campaign is by monitoring brand mentions. You can use social listening tools to track mentions of your brand before, during, and after the campaign. If you see a significant increase in brand mentions during the campaign, it's a good indication that your campaign is having an impact.

Cost per Acquisition: CPA is the money you spend to acquire a new customer. By tracking your CPA, you can determine how much it costs to acquire a customer through your campaign. This metric is handy if your goal is to increase customer acquisition.

The ROI Playbook: Best Practices for Measuring Your Success

Now that we've covered the importance of measuring ROI in influencer marketing and what metrics you can track, let's dive into some dos and don'ts of influencer marketing for higher ROI:

Set Clear Goals

Before launching an influencer campaign, setting clear goals for what you want to achieve is essential. Whether it's increasing brand awareness, driving website traffic, or generating sales, having specific goals in mind will make it easier to measure the success of your campaign.

Choose the Right Metrics

You can use several metrics to measure your campaign's success and optimize influencer marketing budgets, including sales revenue, engagement, brand mentions, CPA, and website traffic. However, choosing the right metrics based on your goals is important. For example, if your goal is to drive sales, tracking sales revenue would be a more relevant metric than tracking website traffic.

Use Tracking Links or UTM Parameters

Tracking links or UTM parameters are a great way to track the success of your influencer campaign and optimize marketing spend. By using unique links or parameters for each influencer or campaign, you can determine how much traffic, engagement, and sales revenue each influencer generates.

Monitor Brand Mentions

Monitoring brand mentions is another way to track the success of your influencer campaign. By using social listening tools, you can track mentions of your brand before, during, and after the campaign. This can help you determine whether or not your campaign is having a positive impact on brand awareness.

Don't Rely Solely on Follower Count

While choosing influencers with a sizable following is important, it's not the only metric you should consider. Instead, focus on engagement rate and audience demographics to measure influencer marketing KPIs, whether or not an influencer is a good fit for your brand.

Track ROI Over Time

Measuring ROI over time is essential for determining the long-term impact of your influencer campaign. By tracking ROI over several campaigns or a more extended period, you can determine whether or not your campaigns are driving sustained results.

Optimize for Long-Term Success

While it's easy to focus on short-term success, it's essential to think about the long-term impact of your influencer marketing efforts. This means choosing influencers who can help you build a lasting relationship with their audience and optimizing your campaign for long-term success.

Disclose Paid Promotions

It's important to disclose when a post is a paid promotion, as failure to disclose could result in penalties, fines, and damage to your brand's reputation. Make sure that you and the influencers you work with are transparent about sponsored content, whether it's a post, story, or video. Use clear and conspicuous language on marketing channels and social channels, such as #ad, #sponsored, or #paidpromotion to ensure that your audience knows that the content is sponsored.

Hit Your ROI Targets with InsightIQ's Solutions

As influencer marketing continues to play an increasingly vital role in modern business strategy, companies must carefully evaluate and optimize the effectiveness of their campaigns by calculating influencer marketing ROI.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules that allow different software to chat with each other. A social media aggregator API lets an app capture posts, comments, and user data from platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.

Read this article to understand the benefits of social media aggregators, how they are applied for various brands on multiple social media platforms, their applications, and how to choose the best social media aggregator for your brand.

Supercharge Your Social Media Feeds: Benefits of API Aggregation

Forget juggling a million tabs or logging into each social media network individually. Get a command center at your fingertips through a social media aggregator and change the way your social media content looks and feels.

Here's how social media aggregators can transform your digital marketing:

1. Streamlined Social Media Management

A social media aggregator brings all your feeds - mentions, comments, reviews - into one dashboard. It serves as a single place to monitor conversations, respond to customers, and schedule posts on your social media feed.

2. Enhanced Brand Advocacy

Let your customers be your biggest fans. User-generated content (UGC) is the best way to acquire new customers and build brand trust. A social media aggregator platform makes it easy to find and curate custom posts where people rave about your brand. Turn testimonials, photos, and videos into social proof that converts casual browsers into loyal customers.

3. Increased Engagement

A static website? That was so yesterday! Create a live, dynamic social media feed embedded on your site or at events to capture the attention that your brand requires. Show off real-time conversations, run hashtag campaigns, and let visitors know your brand is where the buzz is at!

4. Data-Driven Insights

Behind the likes and comments lies a treasure trove of insights. Aggregated social data reveals what people love (and dislike) about you. It helps you track trends, competitor moves, and overall customer sentiment.

Improved Social Media Content Strategy

Are you struggling to come up with fresh content ideas? Your social media feeds are a goldmine! Analyze what posts get the most love, find pain points, and see what questions your audience constantly asks. Make sure to tailor your social media content to deliver exactly what they want, and watch your engagement skyrocket.

Using a Social Media Aggregator in Application - Top 5 Ways

More than collecting cool posts, social media API integration can be utilized in countless ways. Here's how you can go about it for your brand -

1. Boost Website Traffic & Conversions

Your website needs that exciting energy! Embed a live feed of enthusiastic customer posts, eye-catching user-generated content, or buzzing hashtags. A social media aggregator can help you display a must-read reviews section, similar to Amazon or even gorgeous customer photos - the way Glossier does it. Visitors get obsessed, and that obsession leads to clicks and buys through your social media content.

2. Create Engaging Event Experiences

No more awkward crickets at your events! A live social feed showcasing attendee excitement, contest updates, and your snappy event hashtag would start a digital party on your social wall. Create exciting experiences on social media to engage your audience and build brand awareness.

3. Enrich Digital Signage

Out with the boring, in with the buzz! Instead of static displays, turn those screens into hubs of news and fun with aggregated social posts. Think Starbucks showing off seasonal drink creations or Target flashing those hilarious reviews of weird products. That's one of the best ways of curating a successful social media campaign.

4. Power Interactive Marketing Campaigns

Contests and promotions need that viral energy. Aggregated social content takes them to the next level! Encourage hashtag submissions, run photo challenges, and showcase those entries live on your preferred social media platform. You can derive some inspiration from Nike which has been popular for engaging social media posts through hashtags.

5. Build Trust & Transparency

People want the real deal, and social media proof delivers! Displaying reviews, testimonials, or even those honest questions shows you walk the walk. Create your brand's online presence gradually to make your audience feel welcome. The more trust you build, the better your social media performance becomes.

Which Social Media Aggregator Is Ideal for Your Business?

1. Supported Platforms: Where's Your Digital Hangout?

First, where does your audience live? If it's all about stunning visuals, Instagram and Pinterest should be on your radar.

Love the fast-paced chatter? Twitter is your jam.

Need a mix of everything? Look for a social media aggregator tool that plays well with multiple social media accounts.

You also need to keep a long-term strategy in mind for your social media posts. Choose a social media aggregator tool that is flexible enough to grow with you. It will help give you wiggle room to experiment with your social media strategy and build a feed with a mix of hygienic posts and user-generated content.

2. Features and Functionality: It's All About the Extras

Content Filtering: Want to build that social wall like a pro? Look for the best social media aggregators with smart filtering. This helps you keep more room for relevant content, choose the ideal hashtags for your brand, or even highlight posts from those enthusiastic brand ambassadors.

Moderation: You want to show off the good stuff but keep a watchful eye. Moderation tools let you approve posts before they go live on social media walls - no unpleasant surprises!

Customization: Your brand has its unique vibe, and your social media wall should reflect that. Look for social media aggregator tools with tons of customization options. Change up the layout, colors, and fonts, making it blend seamlessly with your website or event.

3. Ease of Use: Tech-Friendly or Tech-Wary?

Even the most powerful social media aggregation tool is useless if you can't figure it out. Look for a social media aggregator API with a clear, intuitive interface. You can check out helpful tutorials to find your way around it rather than getting into any technical mess.

Moreover, be mindful about giving the responsibility to your team to handle social media management aggregators. Think about this - is it a dedicated team member or someone juggling multiple tasks? The right social media aggregators make the whole process a breeze, giving you more time for the fun stuff.

4. Pricing and Scalability: Plan for the Future

Just like any other business, budget is a key factor in choosing the best social media aggregator. Look for pricing plans that align with your needs and allow room to scale as you grow. Keep these points in mind while sifting through different social media platforms -

Free vs. Paid

Some aggregators offer basic functionality with a free plan. This is a fantastic way to test the waters but might have limitations like fewer supported platforms or customization options. Paid plans unlock the full power of a social media aggregator API.

Tiered Pricing

Most social media aggregation tools use a tiered pricing model. This means multiple plans ranging from basic to enterprise-level, each with different feature sets and usage limits. Carefully compare the plans to find what your business needs to build the ideal social media wall, and what you might need in the future.

Hidden Costs

Always remember to check for additional fees that might be charged for things like extra social accounts, higher usage volumes, or premium support.

Scalability

Your business is growing, and your social media presence should too. Choose a pricing plan that doesn't penalize you for success. Look for flexibility, whether that's the option to easily upgrade to a higher tier or adjustable usage limits.

5. Security and Compliance: Keep Your Data Safe

Trust is key in running and scaling any business. Hence, you should choose a social media aggregator with rock-solid security measures and proper API authentication. This means their data is protected while it is being pulled from those social media platforms.

Your Social Media Aggregation Journey Begins Here

By now, you understand the incredible potential that social media aggregators hold. They transform scattered social content into a powerful tool for driving website traffic, amplifying events, building trust, and supercharging your marketing campaigns.

While choosing social media aggregators, look for the perfect balance of supported platforms, customization features, ease of use, scalability, and a price point that aligns with your business goals.

But the story doesn't end here!

Social media and its underlying APIs are constantly evolving. With the power of AI, improving your social media feed is now going to become easier than ever. The future is all about creating even more immersive connections with your audience.

How To Build An Influencer Marketing Dashboard

Influencer marketing is more than just a trend in 2024. With more than 67% of marketers planning to increase their influencer marketing budgets this year, influencer marketing can rightly be a crucial component of a successful marketing strategy.

However, the real magic of influencer marketing lies in its ability to be data-driven. By harnessing the power of data, brands can fine-tune their campaigns, track performance, and optimize for better results. In fact, 89% of marketers say that the ROI from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels.

However, you need an effective way to gather, analyze, and act on data to truly capitalize on the benefits of influencer marketing. This is where building a robust influencer marketing dashboard comes in. In this guide, we will walk you through the essential steps to create an influencer marketing dashboard so that you can leverage the power of data to elevate your influencer marketing efforts! Let's dive in!

What is an Influencer Marketing Dashboard?

An influencer marketing dashboard is a centralized platform that consolidates all essential metrics, data, and insights from influencer marketing campaigns.

It enables marketers to monitor, analyze, and optimize their influencer campaigns for greater ROI and gauge the effectiveness of each influencer partnership for their brands in real time. An influencer marketing dashboard evaluates an influencer's performance by showcasing their efforts to promote your brand's products or services on your behalf and the degree to which they succeeded in improving brand awareness, demand, or sales.

Why Do You Need an Influencer Marketing Dashboard?

Knowing who is harming and who is helping your brand's efforts to attract new customers is important if you are paying influencers to advertise it.

Using influencer marketing dashboards, you can centralize creator data, track campaign performance, and measure ROI for every individual partnership. Once you zero in on the creators generating a positive return on your investment, you may dedicate more of your funding to them, thus, increasing your brand's reach, trust, and revenue. Visualizing metrics and KPIs on an influencer marketing dashboard can enable better decision-making and optimization, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of your influencer marketing efforts.

Now, let's examine some of the benefits of using a dashboard for influencer campaign management and analysis, as highlighted below.

Benefits of Using a Dashboard for Influencer Marketing Campaigns

Some crucial benefits of using an influencer marketing dashboard include:

Streamlined Data Management

Managing data from multiple influencers and social media platforms can be overwhelming. An influencer marketing dashboard consolidates data from various sources into one unified view.

This means you can track metrics such as engagement rates, follower growth, and conversion rates without navigating through different tools or manually compiling reports.

For instance, you can integrate data from Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok into a single dashboard, giving you a comprehensive overview of your campaign performance in one place. This streamlined approach saves time and reduces the risk of data discrepancies.

Enhanced Performance Tracking

Real-time analytics provided by dashboards allow marketers to monitor the performance of their influencer campaigns continuously.

This includes tracking metrics such as likes, comments, clicks, and shares.

Dashboards visualize this data through charts and graphs, making it easier to identify which influencers and content pieces drive the most engagement. For example, if you notice a particular post receiving high engagement, you can amplify it with additional support or a bigger budget.

Time and Cost Efficiency

Automating data collection and reporting processes through a dashboard can significantly reduce the time and effort required to manage influencer campaigns. Instead of manually compiling data from various platforms, the dashboard automatically updates metrics in real time.

This automation saves hours of manual work and reduces the likelihood of human error. It allows marketers to allocate more time to creative tasks, strategic planning, and building relationships with influencers, ultimately leading to more impactful campaigns.

Enhanced Collaboration and Transparency

Collaborating with several influencers simultaneously can make it difficult to keep track of conversations and campaign data. Using a centralized dashboard that acts as a single source of truth can help marketers foster better collaboration. It ensures everyone involved in the campaign--from marketers to social media coordinators--can access the same information.

This alignment helps coordinate efforts, share insights, and make informed decisions collectively. For example, if a campaign is underperforming, team members can quickly identify the issue and brainstorm solutions together. Enhanced transparency also builds trust with stakeholders, as they can easily access and review campaign performance data.

How To Build Influencer Marketing Dashboard

Building an influencer marketing dashboard requires two steps: identifying key metrics and choosing the right tools.

Let's discuss both of these in detail below.

Identifying Key Metrics

Identifying key metrics that will provide the most valuable insights into your campaign performance is crucial to measuring the success of your influencer marketing efforts. These metrics should align with your overall marketing goals and objectives.

Here are some critical metrics to consider:

Reach: It is the total number of unique viewers of an influencer's content. The greater the reach, the greater your chances of increasing brand recognition, traffic, and revenue.

You can calculate reach by dividing the total impressions i.e., the number of times viewers have seen the influencer's content, by the frequency i.e., the number of times each viewer sees it.

Engagement Rate: It is the percentage of likes, comments, shares, and other engagements that an influencer's content receives. Engagement levels indicate how interested individuals are in what influencers are saying and doing.

You can calculate the engagement rate by adding up the likes, comments, shares, and other interactions and dividing it by reach (discussed above).

Click-Through Rate (CTR): It is the proportion of content viewers who click on a link within an influencer's post. Higher click-through rates indicate that an influencer's content about your brand effectively engages their target audience and persuades them to visit your website or follow you on social media.

You can calculate CTR by dividing the number of clicks received by the total number of impressions and multiplying that by 100.

Conversion Rate: It is the percentage of individuals that complete a desired activity (such as a purchase or a sign-up) after clicking on your sponsored link in an influencer's content. Higher conversion rates indicate an influencer's power over their community and show how well their content can turn interest into actions like generating leads and converting sales.

You can calculate the conversion rate by dividing the number of conversions by the number of clicks on your brand's sponsored link and multiplying that by 100.

Return on Investment (ROI): It is a measure of the financial returns generated from influencer marketing campaigns. Assessing ROI is key to determining whether influencer marketing is paying off for your brand.

Brand Mentions: These are the tags that your brand receives on social media and other platforms. Attributing brand mentions accurately to individual influencers' posts can be difficult; however, a spike can indicate an increase in brand awareness and provide insights into how your brand is being perceived by your target prospects.

You can calculate brand mentions across social networks using social listening tools.

Cost Per Acquisition (CPA): It is the cost of acquiring a new customer through your influencer marketing campaign. CPA helps you understand the cost-effectiveness of your campaign, and setting a benchmark for this metric can help you optimize your influencer marketing efforts without breaking the bank.

You can calculate cost per acquisition by dividing the total cost of your campaign by the number of conversions.

Choosing the Right Tools

Building an effective influencer marketing dashboard also requires choosing the right tools to automate KPI reporting, monitor and manage campaigns, and record analytics data for further optimization.

Here are some tools that must be part of your influencer marketing dashboard:

Data Collection Tools: These include social media analytics software like Instagram Insights and YouTube Analytics, social media listening tools like Hootsuite and Buffer, and influencer marketing platform such as InsightIQ for tracking campaign performance

Data Integration Tools: These include social media APIs like those from InsightIQ (discussed below) and Zapier to connect different apps and automate workflows

Data Storage Tools: These include database systems like SQL, NoSQL, and MongoDB and cloud storage services like Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS

Data Visualization Tools: These include dashboard software like Powe Bi and Google Data Studio and custom dashboard tools like those offered by InsightIQ that use JavaScript libraries like D3.js and Chart.js for more tailored visualizations

Project Management Tools: These include task management tools like Trello, Asana, or Jira and communication tools like Google Meet, Slack, and Microsoft Teams

Designing Your Influencer Marketing Dashboard (A Step-By-Step Guide)

Now that you know what an influencer marketing dashboard is, its purpose, its benefits, and how you can plan it, let's check out the steps to designing one:

Step 1: Define Your Objectives

This first step to building your influencer marketing dashboard the right way involves establishing clear and measurable influencer marketing goals that align with your overall influencer marketing strategy.

Without this step, your dashboard might include pointless or excessive information, making it more difficult to interpret and use your data.

Are you attempting to increase brand recognition? Or are you trying to boost sales? Establishing a target facilitates the next step of this process, which is ranking and identifying metrics that are key performance indicators (KPIs), i.e., the information you must monitor to assess whether your influencer marketing campaign is successful.

Step 2: Determine Your KPIs

The second step of designing your influencer marketing dashboard is selecting which KPIs to monitor in accordance with your influencer marketing goals. These metrics will be employed to determine a campaign's level of success.

It should be simple for team members and customers to understand your dashboard and act on the information displayed. Therefore, you should limit your KPIs after you've selected them. You should choose three to five high-impact KPIs for any influencer campaign you run.

For instance, for a brand awareness influencer marketing campaign, some key metrics could be reach, engagement rate, cost per acquisition (CPA), and brand mentions. On the other hand, for a conversion-focused campaign, your KPIs could be reach, engagement rate, click-through rate, conversion rate, and return on investment. If increasing sales or conversions is your goal, you should closely focus on your click-through and conversion rates for your content published by influencers on social media channels. You should also monitor the ROI of your campaigns to gauge whether your influencer marketing efforts are yielding a profit.

This brings us to the following action...

Step 3: Set Up Tracking Links

The third step to building your influencer marketing dashboard involves precisely tracing your referral traffic to determine the return on investment of your influencer marketing. Using UTMs is the best method for doing this. A tiny bit of code called a UTM parameter is appended to the end of a URL to monitor campaign effectiveness. Here is an example:

Using UTM parameters enables more precise identification of referral traffic sources by web analytics systems like Google Analytics, helping you accurately track the number of website visitors and conversions attributable to a given influencer.

Using discount codes or affiliate links is another method of tracking referrals from your influencer marketing campaigns. While they require more work to set up and maintain, they can be a great way to encourage influencers to produce more content for your brand and encourage call-to-action responses from their audiences.

Step 4: Convert Numbers into Visual Data

This provides a visual context for your data that clients and marketing teams may use to measure their influencer marketing efforts accurately. Furthermore, it is simpler to take action when reports are easier to read. Here is an example from the InsightIQ influencer marketing platform:

Graphs and charts make your data look less boring and enable you to spot trends that can help you optimize your campaigns for desired results. With InsightIQ, you can customize your dashboard to reflect your brand's aesthetics, highlight key metrics within a user-friendly layout, and transform as much of your numbers into visual data to facilitate simple understanding and informed decision-making.

Step 5: Automate Your Analytics Reporting

Dashboards are designed to help you assess how well your approach works on various social media platforms. Whether your approach makes use of smaller ""micro-influencers"" or more in-demand content creators, your investment can mount up quickly, particularly if you are managing several campaigns at once.

You must discover profitable campaigns early to maintain an optimized marketing budget and produce a good return on investment. The primary disadvantage of using a dashboard tool or manually tracking your data in a spreadsheet is that you have to remember to check your data--something that is all too easy to forget about when you have a hectic schedule. This is where automated reporting can help you save time and money.

With an AI-powered influencer marketing platform like InsightIQ, you can fast-track data compilation and generate instant automated campaign reports that provide valuable insights across all social media activities. Whether you want to dig deep into content views, likes, shares, and clicks, explore the impact of aggregated campaigns to decipher the bigger picture, or simply enhance your influencer marketing strategy with transparency, automating your analytics reporting is an important final step to create an effective and efficient influencer marketing dashboard.

What is an Instagram influencer database?

There are different ways of creating such databases. However, most brands and influencer marketing agencies opt for the traditional method--one that involves finding Instagram influencers manually.

But there's a problem with this approach: filtering the database can become challenging. If you're manually searching for influencers on Instagram, you can analyze their profiles based on:

Follower count,

Content they publish

Engagement they receive from their audience.

But that's not the deciding criteria at all times.

When building their own database here, Irresistible Me's social media manager shares:

""One challenge we faced was filtering influencers based on specific demographics like location, age, and interests. The database helped us overcome this by offering advanced search filters and detailed profiles. This made it easier to find influencers who perfectly matched our target audience.""

With an Instagram influencer database, you can:

Enable advanced search filters to find relevant and niche influencers

Enrich the effectiveness of your influencer marketing campaigns

Verify the quality of influencers

Factors to consider when searching for an Instagram influencers database

To build your influencer database--first, look at the different factors you need to take note of while identifying the right-fit influencer.

Here are 5 factors you must consider before building your influencer database:

""Check what % of followers are fake. So many influencers inflate their numbers and many tools and businesses don't know how to spot these fake followers and that's super important when calculating their rates!""

So, analyze audience comments and fake followers on the influencer's profile. If the fake followers rate on the influencer's profile is more than the actual followers, or is relatively higher--chances are the content won't reach the right audience.

Engagement rate

Look for influencers with strong engagement rates--their content performance and impact indicate whether you should collaborate with them or not.

Content quality

Are the visuals in the influencer's reels clear? Do the reels have a better audio quality? Do they present their ideas well? Do they make use of captions? If yes, how detailed are these captions? Make sure to assess the influencer's content in terms of video quality, audio quality, content delivery, and tone of voice.

Audience demographics

Does the influencer's audience align with the topics you care about? Or, is their audience active in the geographical locations they're targeting? Consider audience demographics like their location, age, gender, and interests.

Platform features

Filtering and search capabilities

Can you filter the influencer based on the audience demographics, follower count, fake followers rate, engagement rate, or purchase intent? With advanced search and filtering capabilities, you can find new influencers in your niche.

For example, filtering the influencer profiles based on topics like home decor and the creator's brand affinity with brands like Anthropologie.

Influencer analytics

Rahul Vij, the CEO of WebSpero Solutions says, ""When determining the credibility and authenticity of influencers listed in the influencer database, we look at engagement rates, follower growth, and brand affinity.""

Irresistible Me, a haircare brand advocates this and shares that they look at a few more metrics beyond engagement rates and follower growth. They look at the influencer's content quality, past collaborations, and fake followers.

To dive deep into each of these metrics, you need a detailed influencer analytics system that analyzes metrics like engagement rate, purchase intent, fake follower rate, audience demographics, and overall ROI through sponsored posts.

3 Instagram influencer Database to Enable Influencer Discovery

Ease of use, customer support, and advanced filtering capabilities are some of the aspects marketers look at when choosing the right influencer database.

Here are 3 influencer databases we picked from the larger pool based on their reviews from software review sites like G2, Capterra, and Software Advice.

InsightIQ

InsightIQ is an influencer search tool that helps you discover influencers, track influencer campaigns, and measure ROI from each campaign and influencer. It has an influencer database of 450M+ influencers and creators on social media platforms--Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok.

Creator search discovery

When you use InsightIQ's Creator Search feature, you can choose from multiple search filter options like audience location, creator contact options, and more.

When you click on the more filters option, you'll see the complete list of search filters to choose from. Once you have selected the relevant filters, you'll get the narrowed-down influencer search database.



Influencer analytics

When you use InsightIQ to find a specific influencer's profile analytics, you can monitor metrics like their engagement rate, sponsored posts performance, and average likes and comments per post.

Besides knowing the influencer's follower count, you can understand the quality of their followers, and identify fake and suspicious followers.

Besides the engagement rate, you can also understand the intent of the audience's comments--positive, negative, or purchase intent.

Furthermore, you can analyze the influencer's audience based on their brand affinity, and interests to find whether the audience's interests align with your customer interests.

For example, if the influencer's audience is interested in topics like weddings and you want to market a home decor product--this influencer won't be the right fit even when they talk about home decor and furnishings.

Cons

HypeAuditor

HypeAuditor is an AI-powered influencer marketing platform with a database of 149.6M+ creators. Besides the database, the tool offers a relationship manager that lets you communicate with the influencers and manage their payments.

Key features

Influencer discovery: Filter the influencers based on their location, age, gender, ethnicity, and interests, and identify niche influencers.

Pros

Cons

Contacting influencers available via Gmail account--and not through the platform.

Pricing: Contact for pricing

Modash

Modash comes with a database of 250M influencers and analyzes your campaigns. Beyond just the influencer database tool, it offers a relationship manager that lets you communicate with the influencers without leaving the platform, unlike HypeAuditor.

With the Influencer Discovery feature, you can find influencers from a database of 250M+.

Steps to Choose and Evaluate the Right Database

Ready to purchase the influencer database for your influencer marketing nerds? Don't rush. Instead, do the following to evaluate the database that meets your needs.

Assess your needs

Do you need just an influencer database tool that lets you build the database? Or do you need something more than a database--something that offers influencer outreach and communications tools or tracks influencer campaigns?

Determine the budget and ROI

What's the budget you're looking to spend on the tool? Decide on the budget and what's the ROI you want to generate out of it.

Do your research

Go through the pricing page on the tool's website to check the pricing and features offered under different pricing tiers.

Use software review sites like G2, Capterra, and SoftwareAdvice to read what users are saying about the specific tool (and even compare two or more tools together).

Check out case studies to understand how the product helped their customers achieve relevant results

Seek advice from peers in your industry and ask them about the tools they have opted for and why

See the selected tools in action

Once you have selected the influencer based on your research, do either of these:

Sign up for a free trial and try the tool

Watch the product demo (if available on the website)

Side note: If the product tour is unavailable on the website--which is most likely to happen--book a demo with the sales team and get a live walkthrough of the product, understanding the product features, pricing, and support.

Deploy and train your team

Once you have purchased the influencer database, deploy it and conduct training sessions.

Give your team all the resources needed to learn about the tool--video tutorials, help docs, use cases, and case studies to help them understand the tool better

Showcase examples of how marketers can integrate the tool into their workflow.

Best practices for using an Instagram influencer database

Want to make the best use of your influencer tool? Here are 4 expert tips that you can leverage:

1. Regularly update your database search

""Influencer metrics can change rapidly, so keeping your searches fresh ensures you're always working with the most relevant and effective influencers for your brand.""

--Social Media Manager, Irresistible Me

2. Validate the data through your research

""While these social media platforms offer extensive information, cross-referencing it with other sources--like the influencer's actual social media profiles--can provide additional layers of authenticity. This ensures that you're making informed decisions based on the most accurate and comprehensive data available.""

3. Get to know influencers beyond the numbers

""The database is just a means to an end, but that human intervention is so crucial -- not only to double and triple-check that the info in the database is correct but to get to know the influencers beyond their numbers and data by spending time on their profiles and viewing their content/communities. That's the only way you can provide real, long-term value to your brand and your audiences.""

If you're wondering what Vetrone means by spending more time on the influencer's profile, here's what it means and what you should be doing:

""I look at engagement rates--it's not just about the number of likes and comments but the quality of interactions. Are followers leaving genuine feedback or just emoji responses? This helps gauge real influence versus fake engagement. Professionalism is next. Established influencers usually have a consistent posting schedule, high-quality content, and a clear sense of their brand. I also give weight to their reputations within industry circles and peer reviews. I look at engagement rates--it's not just about the number of likes and comments but the quality of interactions. Are followers leaving genuine feedback or just emoji responses? This helps gauge real influence versus fake engagement.""

4. Prioritize quality over quantity

""Instead of focusing solely on influencers with the largest reach, consider micro-influencers who may have smaller but highly engaged and loyal followings. These influencers often provide better ROI and can be more cost-effective than macro-influencers with larger, more diverse audiences.""

How to choose the right influencers for your brand

In 2014, one of the top football players and popular athletes of all time Christiano Ronaldo started promoting Pao, a 'facial fitness tool.' The campaign was mocked worldwide for choosing a footballer for a product like Pao and failed to connect with its target audience. The story is one among the many that showed that choosing an influencer for a campaign is a lot more than looking at their number of followers. For a successful campaign, marketers have to evaluate a lot of factors and choose influencers best suited for their brand.

August 1, 2023

This article explores how to choose the right influencers for your campaign, the red flags to look out for, and where you can find creators for your brand.

What is the importance of choosing the right influencer for your brand?

Here are five reasons why companies should spend time and resources to choose an influencer for their brand:

Choice of influencer can make or break the campaign

Choosing the right influencers is important to reach the target audience

The choice of influencer can significantly affect your ROI

Influencer reputation affects your brand

A good selection process is important to avoid influencer fraud

Let's have a detailed look into these reasons:

1. Choice of influencer can make or break the campaign

Influencers are at the center of every influencer marketing campaign and the wrong choice can be disastrous. For instance, a while ago, Volvo collaborated with chrisellelim, a fashion and lifestyle influencer with around 1.5mn followers to promote their brand. Even though the influencer had a large following and her audience trusted her, the campaign failed because it was completely off-brand for both Volvo and the influencer.

When you work with an influencer, you're putting your brand in their hands. And the success of your campaign depends on the creator's ability to move their audience.

2. Choosing the right influencers is important to reach the target audience demographics

Reaching the target audience is an important factor that determines the success of any marketing campaign. For a successful influencer campaign, brands should carefully examine their influencer's audience demographics and ensure it aligns well with their target audience.

This is partly what went wrong with the Christiano Ronaldo campaign we mentioned in the beginning. The star athlete has had multiple successful campaigns with brands like Nike, Adidas, EA Sports, and many others. His followers look up to him for his recommendations about sports apparel and equipment. But they were just confused by the athlete promoting a facial fitness tool.

3. To get good ROI

Influencer marketing campaigns are largely perceived as expensive, and with good reason. Major influencers may charge anywhere from $10k to $25k for a single post. The wrong choice of influencer can significantly affect a campaign's bottom line.

By spending more time and resources to choose the right influencers, marketers can significantly improve their ROI and build a successful influencer marketing campaign. One of the best examples of this is from Sperry, a boat shoe company. Around 2016 - 2017, the company created a campaign with around 100 micro-influencers who had purchased their products earlier. The campaign saw a sharp increase in website traffic and their campaign got around 4.7mn impressions.

By spending time on finding the right influencers, Sperry was able to create a successful campaign with minimal resources.

4. Influencer reputation affects your brand

In an influencer campaign, a brand is using a creator's 'influence' over their followers to promote a product or service or an event. And by working with them, a company is merging its own brand with the influencers'. This means that if the influencers make a controversial statement or face public backlash, it can affect the brand's reputation too.

There's no shortage of stories of brands rushing to drop influencers and issuing press releases and apologies after one of their influencers got involved in a controversy. In 2019, brands like Sephora and Dolce & Gabbana dropped YouTuber Olivia Jade Giannulli after her involvement in the college admissions scandal.

5. To avoid influencer fraud

While influencer fraud is not as common as it was, the reality is that there are plenty of social media accounts that buy followers and engagement and even impersonate other celebrities and influencers. There are still plenty of fake influencers on just about all social platforms.

How to choose the right influencer for your brand?

Examine these factors in detail to choose the right influencer for your brand:

Influencer's audience

Influencer's niche

Engagement rate

Brand and tone fit

Brands they have previously worked with

Success of their previous campaigns

Overall public image

Let's examine each of these factors in depth:

1. Influencer's audience

One of the first steps to choosing an influencer is to examine their followers and evaluate if they are who you want to reach through your campaign. You won't have much luck trying to sell baby clothes through an influencer whose followers are largely motorcycle or car enthusiasts.

Before working with an influencer, check their audience demographics.

2. Influencer's niche

Followers of an influencer trust them with recommendations in an area they're specialized in. For example, a fashion influencer's followers will trust them if they recommend clothing or a jewelry brand. But the same audience probably won't take recommendations on fitness or travel destinations from them.

This was largely demonstrated by the example of the Volvo ad we discussed earlier. The brand may have had more success if they worked with influencers that often talk about cars or a related subject.

3. Engagement rate

In many instances, marketers often turn to follower count to choose influencers for their campaigns. While audience size does matter, audience engagement often has a stronger correlation with the conversion rate.

Engagement rate as well as the type of engagement shows the connection between an influencer and their followers. Even if a nano or a micro-influencer has a small following, if their followers regularly share their posts or leave good comments, they are likely to trust the creator's recommendations and take action.

The opposite is also true. Even if an influencer has a large follower count and engagement rates, if their comments are filled with trolls and spam content, marketers may have a tough time driving conversions.

A loyal audience weighs more than a large number of followers when choosing an influencer.

4. Brand and tone fit

It's not enough to find a creator that works in the same industry as the brand you're trying to promote.

For instance, if a fashion company is known for its soft themes, pastel colors, and wholesome approach to branding, it may not make much sense for them to work with an influencer who is known for their very loud voice and aggressive themes.

5. Brands they have previously worked with

There are multiple aspects to this. For starters, if they have worked with your competitors, it may not be a good look for your brand if they work for you. But it also may be an opportunity to draw customers from your rival brand.

Another aspect is if they have worked with brands with a negative reputation. If a business they have worked with later became known for scams or defrauding their customers, it may not be the best idea to work with them.

6. Success of their previous campaigns

If they have had previously successful campaigns, it may be an indicator of the quality of an influencer's content and audience. Their previous collaborations could also indicate whether they're easy to work with or not and can even be an indicator of the success of future campaigns.

7. Overall public image

This is fairly obvious; you would want to work with an influencer that has a fairly good image. If they have had recent negative press or if they got into some controversies recently, it may not be the best idea to work with them.

What are the red flags you should look for when choosing an influencer for your campaign?

It may not be easy to figure out which influencers are best suited for your campaign. But it's slightly easier to figure out if you should avoid working with a creator. Here are a couple of red flags to look out for.

Sudden changes in follower count or engagement rate

If an influencer exhibits sudden follower growth there's a possibility that they have purchased followers or engagement.

Of course, you shouldn't consider this as conclusive evidence of influencer fraud. Influencers may also experience sudden organic follower growth if any of their content suddenly went viral.

At the same time, the absence of sudden follower growth doesn't mean they haven't purchased followers. There are services that send fake followers in small batches to avoid these sudden spikes in the metrics.

Too much spam in the comment section

Odds are if an influencer has a solid following, there will be some spam in their comment section.

But if there are just too many spammers in the comments, it may indicate that they don't engage well with their audience. Over the course of time, the creator may lose the followers' trust.

It's best to avoid such influencers.

Large following despite poor content quality or irregular posting frequency

This is once again an indicator that the creator has purchased followers. Most social media platforms require influencers to post regularly to maintain their reach and following. If people don't like their content, it will kill their reach.

And of course, if they are sharing poor-quality content, it may not look good for your brand.

Negative press

If they have received negative press recently, it may be a good idea to avoid them, at least for a while. If they constantly get negative attention in the media, it may look bad on your company or brand.

Of course, a negative press is not always a bad thing, especially if it's for a good reason or values that your brand represents.

Followers without profile pics or without posts

This is once again another indicator of influencer fraud. Businesses that sell fake followers rarely put in the effort to make complete profiles with profile pictures or even full names. These profiles also tend to have zero posts and single digital followers.

Marketers may find a couple of such profiles among followers of even major celebrities. But if there are too many of them, it may suggest a problem.

Poor reputation among other marketers

Before working with an influencer, it may be a good idea to run their names with other marketers in the industry. This way, you can be aware of any issues while working with specific influencers and stay clear of them.

It may also be a good idea to avoid influencers who have worked with your direct competition or have promoted opposing products or services.

What are the different ways to find influencers best suited for your brand?

There are many different approaches that marketers use to find influencers. The first and the most obvious is to manually go through social media platforms and look for influencers with a good following and engagement who are a good fit for your brand.

But since you don't get a lot of engagement or audience demographic data with this approach, it's tough to find the right influencers.

Another approach to influencer search is to go through an influencer marketing agency and find a creator suitable for your campaign. Agencies usually keep a close watch on the influencers they manage as well as their follower demographics and engagement metrics.

But it can be a bit tricky to work with influencers when you have someone in between. And of course, you'll be limited to the influencers the agency works with.

One of the best ways to find influencers would be through an influencer marketing platform. These platforms offer a plethora of data about influencers, audience authenticity, engagement metrics, and previous campaigns, and many even offer a direct line to the influencers on the platform.

There is no shortage of influencer marketing software that can help marketers with everything from just finding influencers and creators to building campaigns and tracking metrics. If you choose to work with an influencer marketing platform, ensure that the platform offers both public and authenticated data.

Businesses pay influencers to promote their products or services on social media channels. Influencers, often boasting large follower counts, are trusted by their audiences, which makes them an ideal vehicle for brands to extend their reach.

It can be primarily categorised based on the influencer's audience:

Step 2: Uncovering the Best Influencers for Your Brand

However, it's vital to track metrics using influencer marketing metrics to measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts.

As an example, Allbirds, the footwear company, partnered with influencers to showcase the versatility of its sneakers, and the campaign was a huge success.

In essence, with the correct influencers and accurate result tracking, influencer marketing can significantly boost your ecommerce store's reach and sales. This is why influencer marketing works and why it's becoming an increasingly preferred method of utilising influencers to promote ecommerce businesses.

Top 5 Effective Influencer Marketing Strategy for Ecommerce brands

Sponsored Ads

A smart strategy for your ecommerce business is to leverage influencer marketing and create sponsored ads with social media influencers. Rather than using traditional advertisement channels, online sponsored ads with influencer campaigns offer a unique way to pique consumer interest. By placing the focus on the customer instead of the brand, these ads become a potent vehicle for your influencer campaign. It's an effective method to connect with your target audience.

Affiliate Marketing

This influencer marketing strategy involves a mutual relationship where an influencer earns cash for each sale they bring to your store. It's a fruitful way to leverage influencer marketing. With this approach, influencers can accumulate more revenue than with a conventional agreement, ensuring your strategic actions result in direct sales. It's a solid way to ensure you're not investing without clear, measurable objectives.

Influencer Takeovers

Social media platforms like Instagram have introduced an exciting way to collaborate with influencers. By allowing an Instagram influencer to ""take over"" your social media account, you can broaden your reach and visibility. It's a unique way to find influencers who connect with your target audience and share engaging, new content, making it a popular choice for an influencer campaign.

In-Person Events

Physical events provide an excellent opportunity to connect with influencers and customers in a different, more intimate way. Social media influencers can attend these events and share their experiences on their platforms, adding a personal touch and reaching out to their followers. By selecting niche influencers who excel in these environments, you can boost your event's reach and efficacy.

Giveaways

Who doesn't love free stuff? Collaborating with influencers to host giveaways of your products is another effective influencer marketing strategy. Not only does this create excitement among your target audience, but it also raises awareness about your products. By incorporating your signature product along with newer or lesser-known items, you can introduce a variety of offerings to a broader audience.

Remember, the key to successful influencer marketing is to select the suitable influencers for your brand and to understand your target audience well. This understanding allows you to create campaigns that resonate with them, making your efforts in leveraging influencer marketing more successful.

Collaborating with Influencers to Drive Ecommerce Sales

Businesses can collaborate and establish long-term partnerships with influencers by following these strategies:

Choosing the influencer: Selecting the suitable influencer for your brand is paramount. This involves researching and identifying those relevant influencers who share your brand's target audience, niche, tone and vision. Don't get caught up in the follower count or popularity. Instead, look for quality over quantity and relevance over reach. Using tools like Google Analytics can be beneficial in this stage.

Clear and Respectful Communication: The next crucial step in building influencer relationships involves clear and respectful communication. Set your expectations, goals and guidelines from the start, and be transparent about your budget, timeline and deliverables. Respect their creative freedom and avoid being overly controlling. Remember, influencers aren't your employees, they're your partners. Their creative input is vital to make influencer marketing work.

Provide Value and Support: Providing value to influencers can go a long way in creating long-lasting relationships. Show appreciation for their work, offer fair compensation, incentives, recognition, and growth opportunities.

Be Consistent and Reliable: To establish trust, be consistent and reliable. Maintain regular contact, fulfil your commitments and address any issues promptly. Show your influencers that they can depend on you and that you value their time and effort.

Seek Feedback and Improvement: Measuring and evaluating the results of your influencer marketing campaigns using tools like Google Analytics can be crucial for improvement. Seek feedback from influencers, respect their expertise, and make the necessary changes. Always show willingness to learn and grow.

Nurture the Relationship: Finally, build a genuine relationship with influencers. Show them that you care about them as individuals and not just business partners. Regularly send personalised messages, celebrate their achievements, and involve them in your brand's vision and mission.

By following these steps, whether you're collaborating with nano influencer, a macro influencer or an ecommerce influencer, you'll not only create brand awareness but also establish a meaningful relationship with the influencer. These relationships offer immense benefits ecommerce brands in the long run, as influencers can significantly boost brand visibility and trust among their followers.

How to use Influencer Marketing Platform for Ecommerce Business

Create an Influencer Database: The first step involves setting up a comprehensive database of influencers. This catalogue includes detailed information like their social media handles, contact information, interests, follower count, engagement rate, and price per post. By continuously updating this database, you can effortlessly pair your brand with the most suitable creators, leading to fruitful collaborations.

Thorough Influencer Verification: An important aspect to consider is the authenticity of influencers. By conducting comprehensive influencer verification, your platform can build stronger brand-influencer relationships and formulate better marketing strategies. The process helps in predicting returns accurately and saving the brand from any legal implications due to misrepresentation or false advertising.

Clear Goals and Expectations: Setting clear objectives for your influencer marketing campaign is essential. This not only clarifies the task for the influencers but also ensures alignment with your overall ecommerce business goals.

Continuous Tracking of Followers and Engagement: Consistently monitoring the follower count, likes, comments, and shares on your influencers' social media platforms is crucial. These metrics provide an insight into the influence they wield and helps identify potential collaborators.

Influencer Marketing ROI: Understanding your Return on Investment (ROI) for influencer marketing campaigns is critical. It gives you an idea of which campaigns and influencers deliver the best results and the expenditure involved in your influencer marketing efforts. To drive sales, consider the cost per action, total conversions, and total revenue. For brand awareness, measure reach, impressions, and website traffic.

Open Line of Communication: Establishing and maintaining a robust communication channel with your influencers is essential. Regular check-ins ensure both parties are satisfied with the collaboration, and any grievances can be addressed promptly.

August 1, 2023

Facebook may not be the first social media platform to come to mind when you hear 'influencer marketing' but, with 2.93 billion monthly active users globally, Facebook is still the most popular social media even in 2023.

Mark Zuckerberg said, ""I think that any good vision of the future has to involve a lot more people being able to make a living by expressing their creativity and by doing things they want to do, rather than things they have to -- and having the tools and the economy around them to support their work is critical,"" in the first-ever creator week held by Instagram.

He also announced to invest $1 Billion into the creator economy by the end of 2022. And, this alone testifies how Facebook influencer marketing is the next big thing.

Why use Facebook influencer marketing for your brand?

We understand the hesitance that comes with using Facebook for influencer marketing. But, after Meta announced a $1 billion investment into the creator economy and Facebook being the 2nd most used global app (source: Hootsuite), we can't deny its potential.

Facebook is not just an app, it has become a way of life for a lot of different individuals. It also is the place where 19% of U.S. consumers (source: Insider Intelligence) start their shopping search.

All the statistics point towards the rise of Facebook as an essential influencer marketing platform. And, if you're not considering Facebook for influencer marketing, then you're leaving money on the table.

With all that said, let's brush up on some basics.

What is influencer Marketing?

Influencer marketing is a type of social media marketing. It involves brands collaborating with social media influencers to promote their products/services online.

Influencers work hard to build the audience and win over trust making their recommendations more valuable to their audience than any form of advertising. In fact, a whopping 53% of consumers make purchasing decisions based on influencers' recommendations.

And, If you're looking to grow your consumer base online, Facebook influencer marketing is just the right thing to do.

Types of influencers

We can categorize influencers into 4 different types based on their audience size and engagement rates:

Source: Phyllo

The engagement rate of an influencer decreases as the size of their audience increases. Hence, onboarding a mix of different types of influencers for a marketing campaign is the best bet to reach different audience segments and encourage engagement.

Prerequisites to finding the right Facebook influencers

With all the understanding of Facebook influencer marketing, it's now time to find the right Facebook influencer for your brand. Finding 'THE' Facebook influencer that aligns with your brand values is a tedious task. But, it doesn't have to be this way if you follow all the steps we've listed below you'll discover the right match for your business.

Before you hop on to find the influencers that fit your criteria it is crucial to -

1. List your business objectives:

It is important to list the goals that you're looking to accomplish through the influencer partnership. Between 3.2 million and 37.8 million influencers in the world (source: EarthWeb), it's impossible to track down the right influencer for your brand without having specific goals in mind.

Here are some examples of business objectives a brand may have:

A. to increase brand awareness

B. to generate website traffic

C. to increase sales

D. to boost content production

2. Map your ideal creator persona

Now that you have your business objectives planned, it's time to move on to the next step - mapping your ideal creator persona. One great tip to add here is to find the influencers that align with your target audience to make the collaboration look authentic and generate results.

Creating an ideal creator persona will help you find the best match on the Facebook influencer database.

There are certain aspects to consider when it comes to mapping the ideal creator persona:

A. What are the creator demographics?

B. What is their number of followers?

Determining the audience size of an influencer helps you understand if they can deliver on your objectives or not.

For example, if you're looking to increase traffic then collaborating with nano and micro-influencers is the best bet. But, if you're looking to increase brand awareness then macro and celebrity influencers work great.

C. What is the engagement rate?

Just like we discussed previously in this article, the engagement rate of an influencer decreases with the increase in the size of the audience. Hence, it is critical to analyze the engagement rate to deliver on your business goals.

D. Are they reliable?

There are a lot of wannabe influencers in the market that doesn't deliver as promised and hence, it's crucial to check they're reliable for the collaboration and can be trusted.

E. Do their creatives match your brand?

There are a lot of different creators with different brand aesthetics. You need to find the one that matches your brand's aesthetics so the collaboration looks authentic and doesn't shock the audience.

Platforms to find Facebook influencers

Now that we're done with the prerequisites of finding the right Facebook influencers for your business, it's time to get into the real work of actually finding them.

Here are the different ways to track down potential influencers:

1. Googling

This is the simplest way of discovering influencers. Just a quick google search with the relevant hashtags and keywords can show you social posts with the information.

To particularly find the Facebook influencers with this method you have to search for site:Facebook.com [your keyword].

For example, if you're looking for a skincare influencer, try site:Facebook.com skincare. This way you can find a potential Facebook influencer in your niche.

2. Using social listening tools

Social listening tools help you uncover all that's being said about your brand online. A social listening tool also helps you track the people that are talking about your brand.

With an influencer being born every day, there are high chances of an influencer talking about you. Check for their credibility and go ahead if you find them to be genuine and capable of influencing your brand.

3. Search by hashtags on Facebook

While hashtags are less popular on Facebook, they still work. Use an online tool that helps in identifying the relevant keywords and hashtags to your brand and try looking for them in the Facebook search bar. You will stumble across various posts that use it and can reach out to them if they tick all the boxes.

4. Try searching other social media

Social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter are more user-friendly, unlike Facebook. You can throw relevant keywords at it and it'll show you the top accounts that use them.

If their profile qualifies as an ideal match then you've found your soul mate influencer. And, there's a huge possibility that Instagram influencers are also on Facebook so shoot your shot and reach out to them.

The same method works best if applied to Twitter as well.

5. Look into the Facebook influencer database

Accessing creator data from the Facebook influencer database is another way to get matched with qualified creators. An influencer database is an online tool that helps you find the influencers that fit well with your brand. Just play around with the filters and the right ones will appear on the screen.

But, there's a downside to using them. With Meta banning third-party data scraping from Facebook, the influencer database's data is illegal to use. Another disadvantage is this the data is inauthentic and old.

6. Ask your followers

Now, this method is more manageable than filtering influencers on the Facebook influencer database. If you have a decent social media following, there is a high chance that your audience can help you match with influencers that fit your brand aesthetic.

Just a quick post or story asking your audience to tag the influencer who seems fit to endorse your brand and voila! You have a list of potential influencers who might be a perfect fit for your brand.

Conclusion

Facebook is the next big thing in the influencer marketing world. If you're not using it to your advantage then you'll lose out on a lot of things including money.

Wondering if there's a quick way to get started with Facebook influencer marketing? Yes, there is! Schedule a call with us to know more about how InsightIQ can help you access the Facebook influencer database and more.

How to Find Influencers and Manage Collaborations: A Complete Guide (+Examples)

Business

May 6, 2024

Imagine yourself paying dollars to influencers for a campaign only to find later that their followers are fake. Your mistake? You bumped into the influencer solely looking at their followers count and now regretting the wasted resources.

Finding the influencers and collaborating with them can be puzzle some--if you have no idea how to find the brand-fit influencer.

Here's everything you should know about finding the perfect influence and managing collaborations with them.

Finding the Perfect Partner: Influencer Selection

There's no perfect influencer. Instead, you need to look for brand-fit influencers who understand and align with your brand and target audience.

Here are 5 steps to find the right fir influencer for your brand:

Step 1: Know your Target Audience

Have a better understanding of your target audience's persona and demographics--their geographical location, job titles, their interests and passions, their socal media usage and the platforms they're active on, keywords and phrases they're likely to search on internet, and so on.

When you have this information in place, you can find influencers who speak to your target audience.

Macro influencers

Macro influencers have an audience ranging between 100,000 to 1 million followers. They are niche-specific influencers and have substantial reach. If you're looking to reach a specific demographic and comparatively a larger audience, it's good to partner with macro influencers.

Working with macro influencers is beneficial for your brand because:

You want a wider reach and tap into a new market segment

You're ready to invest more in influencer marketing

You want to execute larger influencer marketing campaigns and have experience working with nano and micro influencers

For example, Shelby, a home deco influencer with 571K followers partnered with Rowenta USA and showcased how she uses the product and why she likes the product.

Mega influencers

Mega influencers have a massive, 1 million+ following--these people are mostly celebrities and public figures. Although they have tremendous reach, these influencers come with a hefty [price tag, which not many brands and agencies can afford. That's why brands prefer macro influencers instead of mega ones.

Working with mega influencers can be beneficial for your brand because:

You want a madssive, global reach

You want endorsement for your prosuts from a public figure

You're ready to make heavy investments in influencer marketing campaigns

For example, Komal Pandey, an Indian fashion influencer with 1.9M followers has collaborated with Nivea, Maybelline, Swarovski, and Lakme.

Step 3: Define your Influencer Selection Criteria

Brands usually select influencers based on one metric: follower count. But there's more to selecting the right followers beyond their follower count.

When asked Jessica Bane, the Operations Director at GoPromotional, she says:

""Choosing the right influencers is a combination of science and intuition. Part of it certainly is reach and engagement rate; we prioritize influencers who have a highly engaged audience regardless of the size of their following. We also consider content style to ensure it is consistent with our brand, and the influencer's audience demographics to make sure they align with our target customer profile. We highly value influencers who are passionate about our products or services and believe in our brand's philosophy.""

Let's take a look at the following factors that you must include in your influencer selection process:

Audience demographics: Do their demographics comprise moms from USA or working females from Europe? Get to know the influencer's demographics to understand whether you want to reach that specific target audience.

Engagement rate: Do they receive a higher number of genuine comments on each post? Or do they receive a good number of likes but spammy comments? Does the influencer respond to the comments when the followers engage with their post? Look at these factors when determining the influencer's engagement authenticity.

Posting frequency: Does the influencer only have sponsored posts? Or, do they have a mix of informational and sponsored posts on their social media feed. When an influencer only posts sponsored content on their feed, it questions their credibility. So, choose the influencer who has a balance of promotional and educational content.

Content style: Look at the content type, format, and tone of voice the influencer uses in their posts. How do they showcase their values, personality, and opinions through their content? How do they naturally integrate brands and products into their content? Find this out by checking out their social media posts.

Brand alignment: Do the influencer's demographics and the content align with your brand and target audience? Do the topics they talk about align with your target audience? By asking these questions, you can cross-check whether they're the right fit for your brand and products or not.

Now that you know how the filter out the right influencers for your brand, let's find the relevant influencers. Here are 6 ways you can discover influencers:

Use branded hashtags

To find social media influencers that mention you, search for branded hashtags on the specific platform.

For example, when searching for #hubspot on LinkedIn, you'll get a list of posts that mention Hubspot.

If you're searching for the same hashtag on Instagram, you'll see a list of posts under the #hubspot tag.

You can then look through the posts and find influencer profiles who have posted about Hubspot and reach out to them.

Search through industry-relevant hashtags

Identify your prospect's pain points, needs, goals and the keywords they usually look for on the internet. Use those keywords and phrases on the chosen social media platform.

For example, if you sell a personal branding tool for LinkedIn and Twitter, you'll want to work with influencers who talk about LinkedIn and Twitter growth. And that's one of the challenges of your target audience too. So, when you search for the keyword #linkedingrowth on LinkedIn, you'll get posts from people who talk about LinkedIn growth and personal branding.

Leverage influencer marketplaces

Influencer marketplaces help brands and influencers collaborate based on their needs and niches. Before choosing an influencer marketplace platform to collaborate with influencers, ask yourself the following questions:

Does the marketplace have influencers relevant to your niche?

Does the marketplace have influencers who cater to multiple platforms?

Some of the influencer marketplace platforms that you can use include Upfluence, Heepsy, and Grin.

See the similar profile suggestions

When you follow your favorite influencer, you'll get suggestions for other similar look alike influencers that you can follow.

For example, when we searched for Justin Graci's LinkedIn profile, we got suggestions for a few similar profiles that you can explore and connect with.

Similarly, when you follow the influencers on Instagram, you'll get a 'Suggested for You' popup with a list of similar influencers you followed.

Check the influencers your competitors are working with

Go to your competitor's social media accounts and see if they have collaborated with any influencers.

These people are likely to be interested in your brand since they're familiar with your competitor's products and services.

Step 5: Use Influencer Marketing Platforms

Influencer marketing platforms provide you with tools that can speed up your activities such as finding the right influencers and tracking paid campaigns.

For example, with Insight IQ's Creator Mode feature, you can find influencers from a database of 450M+, discover lookalike influencers, and analyze the influencer's demographics and followers, etc.

Building a Winning Campaign: Collaboration Strategies

So you've set up the stage i.e, found the influencers who are the right fit for your brand. Now, let's map out the collaboration strategies for a successful influencer marketing campaign:

Campaign goals

The first step to defining your collaboration strategies is understanding the goal of your influencer campaigns:

Brand awareness: Want to get your target audience to know about your brand and its offerings? Then, collaborate with nano and micro-influencers. Send PR packages to them and ask them to give you feedback on your products, and share with their audience if they find the products worthwhile.

Increase sales: Collaborate with micro, macro, and mega influencers based on your budget. Provide them with discount codes and affiliate links they can share with their target audience to boost your sales.

Build community: Want to strengthen your customer base by building a community? Collaborate with nano and micro-influencers since they have an engaged audience who is likely to trust you more. Do regular collaborations with these influencers instead of one-off partnerships.

Increase followership: Work with micro and macro influencers who have a wider following. Organize contests, giveaways, account takeovers, and live collaborations (Instagram Lives, Twitter spaces, and LinkedIn audio events) with them.

Once you have decided the exact goal you want to achieve with your influencer collaboration, define the KPIs you'll use to track the success of your campaigns.

But make sure to stay away from traditional KPIs. Traditional KPIs don't give you an advanced understanding of your campaigns. They're vague and do t scratch the surface. For example, number of views on the influencer's reel does not give a detailed understanding of the people who viewed the content.

Whereas, if number of stories shared and saves gives a much better understanding of whether the target audience resonated with the content or not.

Content Creation

What are the different content formats that you can utilize for your influencer marketing campaigns?

Here are 5 most used content formats you can double down on:

Sponsored Social Media Posts

Influencers mention the brand or its products in their social media post on the specific platform.

Brands can send PR packages to influencers. Influencers can then try these products and if they like the product, they can share the review on social media or the blog.

Shivam Arora's partnership with The Sleep Company is a commendable example of review collaborations. The review is comprehensive and the influencer mentions that the product was sent to him by the brand. The review also has the link to purchase the product and discount code in the caption.

Account Takeovers

Account takeover is when an influencer posts from your brand's social media account. It's usually done for a few hours of the day. They announce the day and time of the takeover to their audience in advance to increase the engagement level. Once the influencer takes over the account, they may either post on the brand's Instagram feed, answer frequently asked questions over Instagram stories or do a series of posts on a specific topic.

Side note: When doing these content influencer partnerships, make sure the influencer gets enough creative space to use the product and share their honest opinion with you and their audience. That's when their audience will trust them and eventually trust your brand.

Transparency & Disclosure

Is it a paid ad? Is it a free product the influencer received and is reviewing? Will the influencer get a commission if their audience buys the product? Brands and influencers need to be transparent about their partnership with their audience.

Lisa Vetrone, Digital Director at Scenario Communications shares, ""We also communicate guidelines for disclosure and transparency to the influencers so that they're compliant with the most up-to-date regulations.""

So, make sure to clearly state the FTC guidelines and disclosures that influencers must follow before sharing sponsored content:

If an influencer hasn't tried a product, they can't promote it on behalf of the brand

If the influencer had a bad experience with the product, they shouldn't make a positive review

Brands can't use the influencers unless the influencer discloses the partnership. For example, the influencer must use #ad or #sponsored in their post about the brand's products. In the case of YouTube and podcasts, influencers need to verbally mention that the video or podcast episode is sponsored.

If the product gives varying results, influencers should disclose it upfront. For example, if a skincare influencer is promoting an under-eye serum, they must disclose that the product may give different results or not work on specific types of dark circles.

Ensuring Success: Collaboration Management

Communication & Collaboration

When partnering with influencers, it's important to communicate the dos and don'ts.

What do you expect from the influencer during the partnership?

What are the influencer's expectations from this campaign?

Vetrone shares how they communicate with their influencers about the partnership.

""We treat collaborations as such -- like collaborations! We ask influencers to present and pitch their ideas for how they'd like to create content around a specific campaign or product. We really try to stay away from being too prescriptive. The trajectory of these platforms and their successful content has been so creator-driven, and it's for them to lead the way and give us their unique spin. We will present trending concepts or appropriate themes for the brand/campaign but always want to keep it a dialogue and exchange of ideas.""

To communicate better and build a positive relationship with influencers, here's what you should do:

Provide clear briefs and examples of what your brand wants

Be upfront about usage rights

Share important details like the deadline and campaign requirements

Content Approval & Scheduling

Content approval is the process of creating and approving content the influencer has created as part of the influencer collaboration. Having a content approval process in place helps you and the influencer save time, have control over the quality of content that is being published, and ensure that the content aligns with your brand.

While every brand has its own set of rules for the content approval process, here are 5 steps you can use as the template:

Step 1: Submission of Content

The influencer creates the sponsored content and sends it to the brand on the specified deadline.

Step 2: Testing the Content

The content is then reviewed on different parameters such as:

Errors in text or video content, and discount codes

Appropriate placement of the brand, images, and products

Working links and hyperlinks

Authentic storytelling and messaging

Step 3: Getting Feedback

Once your team has reviewed the content, provide feedback to the influencer on their submitted content. This helps the influence to understand and act on the feedback.

Step 4: Implementing Feedback

The influencer is given additional time to make changes to the content. Once the errors are fixed and the content is refined, the influencer will resend the content back to the brand.

Step 5: Scheduling and Publishing the Content

Once all the edits are done, the content will be scheduled and published on the decided date.

Tracking & Measurement

Finally, to measure the performance of your campaigns, track the following KPIs:

With the ROI measurement feature, you can get advanced insights on how the influencer collaboration impacts your complete marketing funnel.

MightyScout

MightyScout is an all-in-one influencer marketing tool that lets you track collaborations and overall ROI.

With the Influencer Discovery feature, you can find influencers from a database of 250M+.

With Influencer Campaign Tracking feature, you can capture influencer content, get alerts on missing ad disclosures and track the campaign's content performance.

Examples of Successful Influencer Collaborations

Example 1: Omnisend's partnership with an e-commerce influencer

Omnisend partnered with Hannah Gardner, an e-commerce influencer and Youtuber where she shares valuable tips and tricks about building a business.

Adele Grigunaite, Affiliate & Influencer Marketing Manager at Omnisend shares, ""We liked that she doesn't sugarcoat and is honest with her audience. She shares that the ecommerce journey might be tough and she doesn't sell a dream but wants to provide as much value as possible for her audience and share the lessons she learned.

Also, we have good communication between us. Hannah understands our tone of voice and what things need to be emphasized in the promotion--with some other influencers that might not be the case, so sometimes you need to set clearer guidelines.""

Nautilus Marketing partnered with a health and wellness influencer for one of their clients for the launch of their wellness product.

Tom Jauncey, the Digital Marketing and SEO expert at Nautilus Marketing says, ""The content shared by the influencer resonated well with our product and the target audience. The success was anchored by the influencer's genuine use and endorsement of the product. Since the majority of the influencer's audience were health-conscious followers, it led to a 30% increase in our product sales.""

He further adds, ""We choose an influencer for our product's branding and marketing based on their respective audience demographics and engagement rate of at least 3.5%. Before we make any decision, we ensure that the influencer's audience is aligned with our target market or not. It is also important to consider their content creation style as it must complement the brand's tone and value.""

How to find micro-influencers for marketing campaigns?

Learn how to effectively find microinfluencers for your marketing campaigns in our latest blog post. Discover strategies and tools to identify the right microinfluencers that can drive engagement and conversions for your brand.

But even though influencer marketing offers high ROI and brilliant engagement for businesses, until recently, they were not accessible for smaller brands. Creators also had to spend a lot of resources and build a following before they were able to monetize their brands.

This led to the popularity of micro-influencers or creators with smaller and often local followings. Let's have a look at where brands can find micro-influencers and why they should work with smaller creators.

Why should brands work with micro-influencers?

Most brands prefer to work with influencers within their industry and with a large following closely resembling their target audience. It works because if an influencer has around a million followers, a single piece of content can create huge engagement and awareness about the brand.

While these influencers have a huge reach, they rarely have a personal connection with their audience. Influencers with more than a million followers rarely send personal replies to every comment on their posts.

That's where micro-influencers win. Micro-influencers have a much smaller following, but they often have a much more personal connection with their audience. They share more intimate details of their lives with their audience and are constantly working to engage with them. Micro-influencers also tend to focus on niche subjects, and their followers are more likely to trust them.

Since they have a much smaller audience, it's also often cheaper to work with them; you can get a micro-influencer to collaborate with you for as little as $100 to $500 per post.

Pros of working with micro-influencers

Lower cost per post: Micro-influencers charge a lot less for a single post compared to larger influencers. Brands can collaborate with them for as low as $100 dollars per post, which makes them more accessible for smaller companies. For larger brands, marketing teams can make quick decisions when working with micro-influencers.

Better engagement with the audience: Micro-influencers engage very closely with their audience, and their followers reciprocate. Their followers feel a much closer connection with these influencers than they may accounts that have a larger following.

The audience is more likely to trust the influencer: Micro-influencers often focus on very niche topics. For instance, they may focus on very specific aspects of fashion, like make-up, dresses, or photography, or niche sections in technology, for instance design, teaching, and others. From an audience perspective, it makes them highly trustworthy in that specific field, and their followers are more likely to take action based on their recommendation.

Cons of working with micro-influencers

It's not easy to find micro-influencers: Because of their smaller following, it's not very easy to find micro-influencers. While working with them, it's important to choose influencers that are closely aligned with your brand and have a following that resembles your target audience. However, performing an in-depth micro-influencer profile analysis takes too many resources.

Lower reach compared to larger influencers: The lower number of followers means your campaign will reach only a limited audience.

What are the top micro-influencer platforms? Where can you find micro-influencers?

The biggest challenge with micro-influencers is that, unlike mega-influencers, they are much more difficult to find. It's tough to find creators that align with your brand and products and have good engagement from your target audience. A simple search on Instagram or Facebook won't help you find micro-influencers or their social media engagement data. It's not easy to understand an influencer's audience by analyzing their profile.

This is where brands can use micro-influencer platforms. These platforms have huge databases of influencers all over the world across different platforms, specializing in different sectors or industries. With these platforms, marketers can access data about the influencers' engagement, previous campaigns, and more.

InsightIQ has data from influencers on Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and more. The platform also ensures that marketers get accurate data on the creators they want to work with. InsightIQ can tell marketers what percent of followers are authentic for a creator and how many are suspicious or mass followers.

The platform can tell the capability of an influencer to influence purchases among their audience by analyzing previous campaigns and engagement metrics.

How to Manage Influencers: 9 Best Tips to Manage Influencers Effectively

The power of influencer marketing to move customers and audiences is unmatched by any other form of marketing. According to a 2023 report from Hubspot, 33% of the gen z population have made a purchase in the last three months based on an influencer's recommendations. Banner ads on the other hand have a conversation rate of 5.31% at best (Wordstream - What is a good conversion rate? It's higher than you think).

Business

August 1, 2023

That said, influencer marketing is tricky. There are a lot of things that happen behind the scenes of a successful influencer marketing campaign. A major aspect of this is of course managing the creators. In this article, we explore how brands and marketers can effectively manage their influencers.

But first, let's look at what defines an influencer and why brands should care about them.

Who is an influencer?

Influencers are creators with a large following on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and others. The definition of a 'large' following varies quite a bit with nano influencers having 1000 to 10,000 followers to major influencers having more than a million followers.

According to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) of the UK, a creator doesn't have to have a specific number of followers to be an influencer. If a brand paid someone to promote a product or a service, ASA defines them as an influencer.

Unlike traditional celebrities like actors, athletes, or musicians, social media influencers owe their fame largely to their content. Of course, there are many influencers who built an audience through social media by showcasing their skills as musicians and chefs and later leveraged the following to launch their careers.

Why should brands care about influencers?

As we mentioned earlier, influencers offer better results than most other marketing channels. Social media is where the world population is hanging out and around 72% of millennials and gen z follow influencers (Morning Consult - Influencer Report).

These numbers present an amazing opportunity for marketers to reach customers where they are.

Social media creators have also proven their capabilities to drive people to take action; to donate towards a cause, buy a new product, or sign up for a sale. The internet is full of stories of influencers raising serious funds for helping people in distress or sending supplies to areas struck with natural calamities.

In this landscape, companies simply cannot afford to ignore social media influencers and what they can do for their brands.

Why is influencer management necessary?

Here are seven reasons why influencer management is important

Influencers are at the center of your marketing campaigns

Influencer management is to prevent influencer fraud

It can help brands better negotiate the costs of influencer marketing

Influencer management is necessary to understand a creator's audience

influencer management is necessary to build long-lasting relationships with influencers

Influencers are at the center of your marketing campaigns

Creators and their brands play a huge role in the success of an influencer marketing campaign. Marketers have to manage the influencers they work with, build good relationships with them, set clear expectations, and ensure they have everything they need to produce good results.

Influencer management is to prevent influencer fraud

Influencer fraud is an unfortunate reality that marketers have to deal with in the creator economy. There are creators who fake their engagement and follower counts on their accounts.

Before engaging an influencer, marketers have to verify influencers' identities and engagement metrics. And they have to do this continuously. For this, marketers need a detailed influencer management strategy.

It can help brands better negotiate the costs of influencer marketing

Influencer marketing offers good returns, but it's still very expensive. Marketers need a strong strategy to manage influencers, negotiate the charges, and keep costs low while creating good results.

Influencer management is necessary to understand a creator's audience

To maximize ROI on an influencer marketing campaign, you need to choose a creator whose follower demographics align with your target audiences and plan your promotion around them.

For instance, if you want to launch a new line of activewear in the US, you'll want to work with sports or fitness influencers with a large following from the country. To do this, you have to analyze creators' content and the people that follow them.

Influencer management is necessary to build long-lasting relationships with creators

When you work with an influencer over a long period, awareness of your brand among your audience grows with them. To get the most out of this, you have to regularly engage with the creators, keep track of their activities and viral trends they may create, and build a rapport with them.

It's not enough to track an influencer's content and followers; marketers should also keep track of their own campaign metrics. These numbers can help guide later campaigns and produce results and is an important aspect of influencer management.

Robust influencer management is important to protect brand reputation

When a company works with an influencer, they're associating its brand with that of the creator. So if they get into any controversies -- for instance, make an unpopular comment or take a stance that doesn't fit with the brand's image -- it can affect the company and how their customers view them.

Brands have to stay on top of any news or social media trends associated with the influencers they work with to prevent this.

Eight strategies to manage influencers

Here's how brands can manage influencers effectively

1. Use influencer databases to find creators suitable for the brand and the campaign

There are plenty of influencer databases and platforms that can help you find creators for your campaigns. These platforms offer detailed insights into influencer content, their audience demographic, engagement rates, previous campaigns they have worked on, and other aspects.

It's important that you choose influencers whose followers fit your target audience. You should also check if the creator's content and brand are suitable for your business.

For example, Daily Burn, a fitness app, chose creators from a wide range of follower demographics; this helped them target different audiences. But they all had very similar goals.

2. Set clear goals and expectations

As with any partnership, everyone involved in influencer marketing should be on the same page about expectations.

Influencers may work with brands in different ways. Micro or nano-influencers may be happy to promote your products or services in exchange for samples or gifts while larger influencers usually charge brands for promotions.

Whatever the nature of the partnership, it's important to set clear goals for campaigns. Brands and creators should agree on the deliverables, payments, and metrics for campaigns.

3. Continuously track followers and engagement

When working with influencers, it's important to stay on top of their social media game. If their engagement takes a hit or if they lose a lot of followers, it can affect the performance of your campaigns. If they suddenly go viral or if some of their content gets good engagement, your brand can capitalize on the new followers by acting quickly.

4. Use an influencer database or creator management solution

Managing influencers and building successful campaigns is complicated. You have to find the right influencers, discuss the nature of collaboration, manage contracts, decide the type of content, work with the creator to finalize it, and track campaign performance.

Influencer management platforms help marketers handle everything from influencer discovery to contracts, collaboration, and even payments.

5. Keep track of campaign success metrics and ROI

By tracking engagement metrics, organizations can have better visibility into their campaigns. It can help them create strategies that work for their brand and a specific creator's audience. It can also help negotiate better contracts with influencers and improve their ROI.

6. Keep an open line of communication and treat them well

To get good results, marketers should communicate well with influencers and be available for them. Be open to hearing them out and keeping them updated about your brand's campaigns. For instance, if your handbag line is launching a limited edition collection, you can offer early access or even branded merch as a gift. If your brand is hosting a music festival, you can offer VIP tickets to your top influencers.

For example, Lululemon created a cult-like following among fitness and sports influencers by giving them free yoga classes, participation in worldwide events, and even including them on product feedback and design.

At the same time, be open to ideas from the influencers' end as well. Ask them to keep you in the loop if they're doing or creating something new.

7. Don't change influencers very often

When working with influencers, you're associating your brand with theirs. When their followers grow, your brand reaches more people. But if you keep changing your influencers, it reduces consistency in your branding and can affect customer perceptions.

But by working with influencers over a long time, you can better understand their brand and their followers, and create campaigns that perform well. You can also negotiate better rates for long-term collaborations.

8. Trust their processes

Even with all the data in the world, odds are no marketer will understand a creator's followers better than they do. Influencers spend a lot of time engaging with the audience and creating content. They have an innate understanding of what makes their audience move.

So while you can definitely discuss what you want and make clear specifications, make sure you get their input as well.

9. Stay on top of legal requirements

In the US, Federal Trade Commission mandates that influencers must reveal their relationships with brands. If they're getting paid for a post or a promotion, the influencers must mention that to their followers. The ASA has also created similar rules for brands and influencers in the UK.

For example, recently, Seaside Casual Furniture was investigated by the FTC over its claims that its products were made in the USA when significant parts were imported.

Failing to comply with these regulations can put agencies, brands, and influencers in trouble and may attract fines and sanctions.

So, why should you organize your influencer tracking spreadsheets based on the stage of your campaign? In short, it streamlines your workflows and ensures you have all the information at your fingertips anytime you need it, from the start to the end of a campaign.

We recommend using six tabs to organize your spreadsheets based on the different stages of your campaign. These should include Prospecting, Outreach, Negotiation, Content Creation, LiveCampaign, and Post Campaign.

Let's see which parameters you should track during each stage:

Prospecting Stage

This is the stage where you search for the best-suited influencers for your brand.

Influencer Names: List the influencers you have contacted for possible partnerships.

Details of Contact: Note the time and mode of communication.

Follow-Up Dates: Maintain a record of the follow-up dates, if required.

Status of Response: Take note of the influencer's response to your outreach.

Next Actions: Note any necessary follow-up actions or steps.

Negotiation Stage

This is the stage where you negotiate the details of your contract with whichever influencers you choose to collaborate with.

Parameters should include:

Influencer Names: List all the influencers you are negotiating and contracting with.

Costs and Fees: Keep a record of the collaboration's agreed-upon expenses and fees.

Contract Specifics: Make a note of any conditions, deadlines, deliverables, etc.

Payment Plan: If appropriate, please include the payment plan.

Notes and Comments: Include any pertinent notes on contract talks or negotiations.

Content Creation Stage

This is the tab that tracks content development. You may track, for example, whether a content brief and relevant assets have been provided to the influencers to work with or how they are coming up on their deadline to submit the content.

Post Campaign Stage

This tab should monitor the performance of the influencers' content and social media updates. You can also check here to determine if influencers have fulfilled their posting obligations.

Parameters should include:

Influencer Names: List every influencer who participated in the campaign.

Performance Metrics: Keep track of the metrics related to each influencer's content.

Feedback: Find out what the influencers say about their experiences and the campaign's outcomes.

Next Steps: Record any plans or actions needed in light of the campaign's outcomes.

Structuring your influencer spreadsheets with these tabs can help you successfully manage and track your influencer campaigns from early prospecting to post-campaign evaluation. This will, in turn, facilitate smooth collaboration and maximize campaign success.

How Can Spreadsheets Help Manage Influencer Campaigns?

Spreadsheets are great for keeping all your influencer data organized, especially if you are a small in-house team working with a handful of influencers.

Note: Spreadsheets are not a good idea for big companies or rapidly scaling ones with large influencer lists.

Here are a few reasons why using spreadsheets can be perfect for small-scale influencer campaigns:

Usability:

Spreadsheets are easy to use, and you don't need any training to get started using them efficiently. They offer a simple method for entering and arranging data. Not to mention, they share and collaborate.

For instance, you may quickly copy and distribute your influencer spreadsheet template to the shared drive of your business. Your staff now has an easy-to-reference resource for your influencer marketing. This promotes teamwork and guarantees everyone access to the most recent data. Need to update a stakeholder on the status of your campaign? Do you want teammates to elaborate? It is super easy with a spreadsheet!

Customization:

A spreadsheet's columns, categories, and campaign-related data points can all be changed to meet your unique requirements. Owing to its adaptability, you can customize the spreadsheet to meet your business's unique influencer marketing needs.

Visibility:

Unless you keep a close eye on everything, it can be very easy to lose track of your influencer's requirements and details of your collaboration. Spreadsheets give your influencer data a visual representation, making it easy to confirm such details with less digging.

You can also spot patterns, trends, and problem areas in your campaigns when you maintain your campaign's performance metrics in a spreadsheet. You may optimize your campaign plan accordingly and make well-informed judgments with a spreadsheet.

Organization:

Spreadsheets provide an organized way to manage influencer data, allowing you to easily manage several influencers, their contact details, campaign stages, and more in one place.

Versatility:

Spreadsheets are useful for more than just keeping track of influencers; they may also be used for reporting, budgeting, scheduling, and performance analysis. Their adaptability renders them an invaluable resource for marketing teams and small enterprises with various requirements.

Cost-Effectiveness:

Last but not least, spreadsheets are affordable for small-scale campaigns with tight budgets because they are usually included in office software bundles or are freely available as stand-alone programs.

Tips and Best Practices to Track Influencer Campaigns with Spreadsheets

Here are some organizational tips to maximize the use of spreadsheets for small-scale influencer marketing campaigns:

Consolidate Data:

To keep things organized and make navigation easier, group relevant data into several sheets or tabs inside the same spreadsheet. You may, for instance, have several sheets for marketing timetables, performance metrics, and influencer information.

Don't Overcomplicate:

Create Frequent Updates:

A spreadsheet for tracking influencers is only useful if its information is current. You must block out time in your calendar for spreadsheet updates and edits.

For each campaign, update your details no less than once every seven days. Moreover, to guarantee accurate follower and engagement data, update your influencer list(s) at least once each month.

Use Dropdown Menus:

To reduce errors and expedite data entry, use dropdown menus for fields with predefined possibilities, such as influencer categories, campaign status, or content type.

Make a Habit of Color-Coding:

Use color coding to draw attention to key information or to set apart various marketing phases, influencers, or KPIs. This can facilitate the identification of patterns or abnormalities and enhance visual clarity.

Take Notes For Your Influencers and Their Posts:

This is especially crucial if you oversee many dozen influencers and their content. Remembering individual posts and events from your campaigns is simpler if you take thorough notes.

Consider how taking notes can help you draw attention to specifics in the campaign, like posts that gained widespread popularity, notable comments or exchanges from the audience, and any delays in influencer content.

However, painstakingly noting these things with several creators will eventually feel more like a full-time job than a change. So, when should you move your influencer campaign tracking beyond spreadsheets?

Challenges of Tracking Influencer Campaigns with Spreadsheets

While spreadsheets are a great resource for organizing influencer campaign data, there are certain challenges to tracking influencer campaigns with spreadsheets.

Let's understand what these include.

Limited Scalability:

As mentioned above, spreadsheets are NOT ideal for large influencer lists. Your spreadsheet can feel pretty daunting once you have dozens of influencers on your list. Managing large volumes of data in a single spreadsheet can lead to performance issues and decreased efficiency.

Security Risks:

Spreadsheets that are kept on shared network files or local discs could be vulnerable to malware attacks, illegal access, and data breaches. It is crucial to guarantee data security and adherence to privacy laws.

Version Control:

Let's face it--data entry can be very time-consuming. There can come a time when you simply don't want to do it any longer. In such cases, it can become difficult for you to maintain updates for your influencer marketing data.

Using spreadsheets can, thus, result in inadequate version control since you might not be able to keep track of spreadsheet modifications over time and ensure that everyone is using the most recent version, especially in group settings.

Dependency on Manual Procedures:

Since spreadsheets primarily use manual data entry and manipulation, there is a higher chance of data inconsistencies and human mistakes. This problem can be overcome by automating repetitious processes, but doing so might call for more funding and technological know-how.

Does this mean there is no better way to do this? Not really. You can use an influencer marketing tool like InsightIQ to track and manage your campaigns.

InsightIQ is a powerful influencer marketing API that provides comprehensive information about influencers and their brands. It is a great tool for getting reliable influencer data easily and in real time.

Influencer Tracking Analytics Demystified: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you have been planning to execute your first influencer marketing campaign but are not sure the influencer analytics you should be accurately? Well, you've landed in the right place.

In this article, we'll guide you on how to analyze the influencer data the right way and identify authentic influencers.

Key Metrics at Each Campaign Stage

Different campaign stages require different influencer metrics. But what do these metrics look like? Here are a few influencer marketing metrics you must track at different campaign stages:

Planning Stage Metrics

At this stage, your focus is on setting up your influencer marketing success. To measure the success of your planning stage, here are three influencer marketing metrics you must track:

Audience demographics: By tracking audience demographics, you can know the age, location, gender, and interests of your influencers' followers--this can help you identify the right influencers to collaborate with.

Engagement rate: By tracking this metric, you'll know the influencer's engagement rate which will help you identify the authenticity of the influencer's follower base.

Content relevance: By tracking his metric, you'll get to know the type of content influencers produce--which will help you understand whether the content influencer creates aligns with your brand or not.

Execution Stage Metrics

At this stage, you'll focus on how your campaign is actively performing. A few metrics you must track here include:

Engagement metrics: By tracking this metric, you'll understand the level of engagement--comments, shares, and saves each influencer is receiving on their campaign posts.

Reach: By tracking this metric, you'll know the audience size the campaign is reaching and the impact of your partnerships with influencers--which is a great deciding factor to collaborate with the influencer again or not.

Impression: By tracking this metric, you'll know how many people are seeing ads within a particular channel and how successful channel A is in accomplishing your influencer goals compared to the other.

Post-Campaign Analysis Metrics

At this stage, you'll focus on how your campaign has performed--after the campaign has been completed. A few metrics you'll track here include:

Clickthrough rate: By tracking this metric, you'll know the conversion-based engagement that comes via influencer content like how many people clicked a specific CTA.

Sentiment analysis: By tracking sentiment analysis, you'll know how your target audience feels about this campaign--positive, negative, or neutral--which further tells you the campaign's effectiveness.

Conversion rate: By tracking this metric, you'll know how successful the influencer campaign was and how you can optimize it for better future outcomes.

ROI: By tracking this metric, you can make informed decisions, allocate resources and budget efficiently, and optimize future influencer collaborations for maximum profitability.

Analyzing Influencer Campaigns

To track influencer marketing campaigns, you need a step-by-step in place to analyze the data.

Step 1: Define Campaign Goals and KPIs

Do you want to increase brand awareness for your client with this campaign? Do you want to increase their sales? Or maybe you want to generate high-quality leads. Understand what your campaign goal is.

Step 2: Implement Tracking mechanisms

Next, set the tracking processes for your influencers to monitor the traffic and conversions you get from each influencer.

But the question is, how will you track the conversion rate from your influencer campaigns when these conversions happen indirectly through the influencers? Whether you're working with new influencers or the ones you've collaborated with in the past, you can track the conversions with two common attribution practices:

UTMs

When influencers include UTMs in their campaign content, you can track the traffic and conversions you get from each influencer's content.

Doing so, you can understand which social media channel drives more traffic and conversions for the campaign. Plus, you'll be able to understand the kind of content that resonates with the audience.

For example, if an influencer collaborated with a SaaS productivity tool and wants to increase feature adoption with the campaign--they'll add a UTM link to the specific feature when sharing with their audience.

Use link tracking tools like Bit.ly or Cut.ly to generate UTM links. Make sure to focus on parameters such as source, medium, campaign, and content to generate the links, and use the link shortener to shorten your links (since the UTM links are quite long).

Here's an example of how a creator tracked engagement on their collaboration post using Cut.ly.

Promo Codes

When influencers use unique promo codes in their sponsored content, you can track which specific influencers are bringing conversions for the campaign. Doing so, you can allocate the resources and budget by focusing on and collaborating with influencers who generate the highest ROI.

For example, Shelby Vanhoy, a home decor influencer shares a promo code 'PRETTYINTHEPINES10' for her followers to use when they purchase the rug from the brand, Ruggable that she talks about in her post.

Custom Landing Pages

Designing landing pages for each influencer helps you track the leads and sales each influencer brings. This will also help you understand the direct results each influencer collaboration brings to your brand.

Step 4: Collect Data

With the help of specific influencer marketing tools, collect the relevant data. Here are the different types of data you need to track:

Engagement data: Comments, social media shares, and saves the specific influencer receives on their sponsored content

Traffic data: Number of visitors, session duration, bounce rates, number of demos booked, and average time on site

Conversion data: Number of conversions, number of signups, number of demos booked, and average order value

Step 5: Analyze the Data and Evaluate Influencer Performance

Benchmarking: Compare the performance based on industry standards and goals. For example,

Trend analysis: Look for patterns and trends in the data to identify what worked well and what didn't.

Engagement

How many comments has the influencer received on the post? What is the level of engagement audiences have on the influencer's post? Is it just a one-word comment, or have the followers shared detailed comments? Has the influencer responded to the comments? Was the content shared or saved (or both) by the followers? Determine the quality of engagement and then calculate the engagement rate.

To calculate the engagement rate, divide the total engagement (i.e., shares, comments, and reactions) by total followers and multiplied by 100.

Engagement rate = (Total engagement) / (Total followers) * 100

Traffic

Did the visitor watch the demo on your website? Did they spend more time on the pricing page? Did they spend more time in the resources section (maybe they read the blog posts or case studies in the resource section)? Did they add the product to the cart? Check the website traffic to see which influencers drove more traffic and how the visitors interacted on landing on the website.

Conversion

How many conversions did each influencer bring? What are the user actions taken? Clicked on the link, visited the website, booked a demo, or added the product to the cart? Calculate the conversions you receive from each influencer.

Step 6: Gather Qualitative Feedback

Once you've analyzed the influencer marketing data and influencers' performance, understand how to improve your future campaigns. For this, understand your audience's sentiment and get feedback from influencers.

Audience sentiment: Analyze comments to understand the audience's sentiment towards the campaign--understand the emotions and how they feel about this campaign.

Influencer feedback: Get feedback from influencers on the campaign--what worked, what didn't, and what are the types of questions their audience asked them on DMs.

Step 7: Create a Comprehensive Report

Once you have analyzed all the data, create the influencer marketing report--either manually or using influencer tools like InsightIQ. Make sure your report has the following essentials:

Performance metrics

Campaign results

Content insights

Influencer performance and insights

Social platform performance

Key learnings and next steps

Step 8: Try A/B Testing

Based on the report generated, make tweaks in your strategy--refining your influencer selection, content strategies used, times of posting, or using better tracking mechanisms. Implement the changes in your campaign and track results. Keep on analyzing the results and optimizing the campaigns for better results.

Tools for Effective Analysis

The best way to analyze influencer campaigns is by using an influencer marketing platform. Here are three tools you can use to track the data.

InsightIQ

InsightIQ is an influencer discovery platform that helps you find influencers, track influencer campaigns, and measure ROI from each campaign and influencer.

With the Campaign Tracking feature, you can measure the ROAS and identify purchase intent in real-time.

With the ROI measurement feature, you can get advanced insights into how influencer collaboration impacts your complete marketing funnel.

MightyScout

MightyScout is an all-in-one influencer marketing tool that lets you track collaborations and overall ROI.

With the Influencer tracking feature, you can track both paid and unpaid influencer campaigns.

With the Analytics feature, you can get insights on the influencer's followers, track conversions, and measure ROI.

Modash

Modash is another influencer marketing tool that lets you find brand-fit influencers and analyze your campaigns. With the Influencer campaign tracking feature, you can:

Capture influencer content

Get alerts on missing ad disclosures

Track the campaign's content performance.

The Role of Influencer Analytics for Brands

How many sales did you generate on your Shopify store? How are people perceiving and talking about your brand? Is your website getting enough traffic? All these questions are crucial for your brand, and to determine the answers--you need influencer analytics.

Enhancing Campaign Effectiveness with Data Insights

When you analyze data from previous influencer marketing campaigns, you can assess:

Which content formats and influencers generate the highest ROI?

Which social media platforms are getting more traction vs. others?

How do different audiences respond to different messaging styles?

How does the campaign impact the brand's perception?

How to allocate marketing budgets more efficiently?

By finding answers to these questions from your past campaigns, you can optimize your future campaigns for maximum impact.

Targeting the Right Audience

By analyzing influencer analytics, you can gather detailed insights on your audience demographics--age, gender, location, and language. This is helpful when selecting influencers with similar audience demographics, as influencers with the same audiences are likely to generate massive impact.

Accurate ROI Measurement

What is the total sales generated with the influencer campaign? What is the total creator cost? And, what's the total ROI generated? With influencer analytics, brands can find answers to all these questions and allocate the budgets for their next campaign accurately.

Navigating Key Metrics in Influencer Analytics

Now that you know how crucial influencers analytics are for your brand, let's understand the most important analytics that you should be tracking and how.

Understanding Engagement Rates

To understand the influencer's engagement rate, you need to uncover different aspects of the engagement--levels of engagement, sentiment analysis and the engagement received on different social media platforms.

Let's understand each of these in detail.

Type of engagement: Are the influencer's followers commenting, sharing, saving, and sending the posts to their friends? Or, are they just passively liking the content?

Sentiment analysis: Are the comments positive, neutral, or negative? Understand the tone of comments to find out whether the followers are genuinely engaging or if it is bots that are writing spammy comments.

Engagement per platform: Check the social media platforms your selected influencers have the highest engagement. For example, influencer A may have a higher engagement on LinkedIn but lesser engagement on Twitter.

Analyzing Audience Demographics and Behavior

When you know the influencer's audience demographics--age, gender, location, and interests--you can identify whether the influencer has the same audience demographics you're targeting or not. This saved you enough resources and you're able to choose the right influencer. Plus, when the influencer's demographics align with yours, the sponsored content the influencer produces aligns with the audience well.

Imagine selecting a fashion influencer whose audience demographics are majorly females between 18-25 in the UK but you want to target females in the USA. Since the influencer's audience is primarily in the UK, the content they produce won't reach the audience you're targeted. So, anticipate the influencer's audience demographics.

Impact of Conversion Tracking on Sales

By tracking conversions, you can understand the direct impact of influencer marketing campaigns on sales.

Some of the metrics that help in identifying the impact of conversion tracking include the number of signups, number of webinars registered, and the purchases made.

Let's say you've executed an influencer marketing campaign for a haircare brand that is running a sale on its products and wants to double down on the sales. When an influencer shares about the sale on their posts and stories, and their followers make the purchase--the campaign's goal is accomplished. The number of sales generated and the ROI generated from the specific influencer are the two metrics that you will focus on.

Identifying Authentic Influencer Accounts

Here's the thing: not every influencer you see on social media is authentic--some even buy fake followers. In many cases, influencers are not aware but they have bot followers. Because of bots and fake followers, neither the engagement that the influencers receive on their content is genuine, nor it can bring any conversions.

So, how can you spot influencers with fake followers or fake accounts?

Spotting fake accounts manually can take you loads of time. Instead, you can use InsightIQ's Instagram Fake Follower Checker to identify fake, bot, and inactive followers. All you have to do is enter the influencer's Instagram account.

Influencer marketing can produce amazing results for businesses and companies in terms of ROI and brand awareness. Unlike banner ads or TV commercials, which people don't look forward to, research suggests that customers like paid promotions, even when it's marked so. But that said, it's not a simple one-click solution. Considerable efforts happen behind the scenes of a successful campaign.

Business

August 1, 2023

A major part of this is finding the right influencer for your brand. It's not as simple as finding an influencer with a large following and signing them on. In fact, the number of followers is only a small factor that determines a campaign's success.

An even more important factor is who the followers are and what they like.

This article explores the importance of influencer audience demographics and how marketers can find them.

Let's explore this in depth.

What is the importance of influencer audience demographics in influencer marketing?

Here are six reasons influencer audience demographics are important for building successful campaigns.

Influencer audience demographics help marketers choose a creator best suited for their brand

They help tailor an influencer marketing campaign to a creator's audience

Audience demographics play a crucial role in protecting a brand's reputation

With granular influencer audience demographics, brands can penetrate new markets

They help prevent influencer fraud

1. Influencer audience demographics help marketers choose a creator best suited for their brand

According to Harvard Business Review, the follower-brand fit is one of the top five factors that determine the success of an influencer marketing campaign. To maximize the ROI, brands have to choose creators that have a following aligned with their campaigns' target audience.

But even too much fit can be a problem. For instance, picture an influencer who talks exclusively about sneakers. If a sneaker brand works with the influencer, its material will compete with other content from the influencer. Research suggests that brands get optimal results when around 9% of an influencer's followers(Harvard Business Review) are interested in what the sponsor brand is selling.

2. They help tailor an influencer marketing campaign to a creator's audience

Different audiences have different preferences; what may work for gen z professionals in the US may not work for millennial parents in India. To reach an influencer's audience, brands have to understand who they are.

With a granular understanding of an influencer's audience, marketers can create content that will resonate well with them. With this information, they can also tweak factors like campaign timings, offers, and discounts.

For instance, people from the US and Europe tend to go holiday shopping during December and sales tend to dip right after Christmas. But this trend is less visible in South Asian countries. With influencer audience demographics, marketers can target customers when they're most likely to make their purchases.

Influencer marketing is expensive, even if it delivers good results. A single Instagram post can cost anywhere from a couple of free products to $10,000.

In most cases, the influencers' rates increase with the number of followers. So by working with influencers with few followers, marketers can keep the costs low. But if these influencers have an audience perfectly aligned with the brands' target audience, they can get high conversion rates and ROI.

4. Audience demographics play a crucial role in protecting a brand's reputation

The history of marketing is filled with unknown cultural differences destroying products and brand reputations. Campaigns that may be a hit in one location can create expensive product recalls or long-lasting damage to reputation in another. Detailed audience demographics information can help brands avoid such situations.

Brands that may not have a presence in certain countries or cities can penetrate the market by working with influencers who have a large following from the location. Brands can also use influencer audience data to launch products for a demographic they have never connected with before.

6. Knowledge of audience demographics help prevent influencer fraud

While influencer fraud is decreasing, a 2022 survey suggests that 64% of marketers are worried about it (The State of Influencer Marketing 2023: Benchmark Report - Influencer Marketing Hub). Audience demographic data can help marketers identify fake followers and engagement and avoid scams to a large extent.

What demographic metrics can you find out about an influencer's followers?

The age group of the audience

While influencers will have followers from diverse age groups, most creators cater to very specific age groups. This information can help marketers tailor their campaigns to specific age groups.

Marketers have long known that different age groups and generations have different values and respond to different things. For instance, millennials and gen z audience care more about a brand's politics (Forbes - I Don't Like Your Politics: How Political Views Can Hurt (Or Help) Your Business) than the generations before them.

While it may look like a very simple data point, the age group of an influencer's audience can help marketers create campaigns that click.

Are the audience men or women?

Gender demographics of the followers are another piece of audience information that most social media platforms offer. Organizations that release products targeted towards a single gender will get better results if the influencers they work with have a following largely of the same gender category.

Follower regions

The location of followers is another easily available data point regarding an influencer's followers. It can help marketers leverage local influencers with followers from specific countries or cities.

Location information can also help marketers prepare to offer the best experience to their customers. For instance, if you're selling a product to customers in Sweden, you should be able to deliver it on time and accept payments from the location.

Follower activity

Different social media platforms offer different levels of insights into follower activity. For example, Instagram and Twitch show when an influencer's followers are active, while Twitter can offer insights into the purchases followers have made recently.

Follower activity can be a useful parameter to launch campaigns and target audiences.

Income and net worth

Income and network parameters, while valuable, are rarely offered by social media platforms. Twitter is an exception here, showcasing an influencer's average household income and net worth.

Once again, these parameters can help marketers choose influencers and build campaigns.

Steps to find influencer audience demographics

There are different ways to find out influencer audience demographics. Here are a few:

Through manual search

Manual search will not be effective, and it's not practical at scale. But if you're looking for influencers, you can make a very broad list of creators you can narrow down later with better data.

Here's how you can find influencer audience demographics through a manual search:

1. Go through content with the least and most engagement

As a general rule of thumb, you can assume people who have engaged on content with little engagement to be loyal followers.

2. Open profiles of people who are commenting on or reacting to different posts

You can also just scroll through the names or profile pictures of people who have engaged with different posts if you don't want to waste time.

3. Check their age group, where they are from, their income brackets, and other information

By looking into followers' profiles, you should be able to get a very rough picture of their demographics.

By asking influencers to send their audience demographic data

You can get a fairly good idea of their demographic data with screenshots from the app. But it requires a bit of trust between the influencer and the marketer since screenshots are fairly easy to manipulate. Another hurdle is that major influencers may not respond to such requests unless you have a working relationship with them or approach them through an affiliated agency.

Of course, this method requires considerable effort and resources, particularly if you want to keep the information updated on your end.

How to find influencer audience demographics through a creator discovery tool

There is no dearth of tools to help you find influencer audience demographics. You can find follower demographics for a single influencer, or you can find influencers who have a specific demographic of followers.

Here's how you can find influencer audience demographics through a creator discovery tool:

1. Find a suitable influencer discovery tool

Ensure you get authenticated data from social media platforms and not just publicly available information.

2. Search for the influencers in the influencer database

Search and find the influencers whose audience you want to understand.

3. See if the demographics align with your target audience

Check if the influencer's followers are largely composed of your target audience.

4. Talk to the influencer

Concrete data is very important in building campaigns. But influencers themselves can help you read between the lines. They may have worked on campaigns and promotions and may be able to guide you on the strategy.

InsightIQ is the companion you want by your side as you take brands to success in the influencer marketing industry.

From intelligently curating a list of possible influencer partners, understanding the quality of engagement, and tracking and assessing a partnership's impact, insightIQ hands you the data so you're not shooting off in the dark with your IM campaigns.
